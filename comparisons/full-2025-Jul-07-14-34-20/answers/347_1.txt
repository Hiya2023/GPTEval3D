Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears as a simple, round cushion without additional patterns, aligning well with the text prompt "A round cushion."
   - The right object, although round, has a detailed floral pattern which was not mentioned in the original prompt.
   - The left one is better in terms of alignment with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and functional as a cushion, with consistent and plausible form.
   - The right object, despite having a clear form, shows additional elements which may not be expected for a simple cushion, potentially reducing plausibility.
   - The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a uniform texture that might lack variety but is consistent.
   - The right object features a vivid, detailed pattern with more texture complexity and sharpness.
   - The right one is better in terms of low-level texture.

Final answer:
