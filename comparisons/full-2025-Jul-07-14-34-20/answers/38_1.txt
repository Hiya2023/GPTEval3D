Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is not clearly triangular and includes unrelated text; the right one is distinctly triangular. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has irregular shapes and looks less like a road sign; the right one has a more structured appearance. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture does not align well with its shape; the right one maintains a consistent triangular texture. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears cluttered and less defined; the right one has clearer textures and shapes. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has noisy geometry; the right one appears smoother and more organized. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one is more aligned with the prompt and exhibits better quality across evaluations. The right one is better.
