Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one clearly shows a square surface with visible legs, matching the "square coffee table" prompt. The right one appears less distinct in the tabletop shape. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more consistent structure with clear, logically positioned legs and table surface. The right one appears less defined and coherent. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with the geometry, especially on the tabletop and legs, while the right exhibits misalignment. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays more distinct textures on the table surface, while the right one appears blurred. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows clear, organized geometry with visible leg details, compared to the noisier and less defined right one. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one shows better alignment with the prompt, consistency, texture, and geometry. The left one is better.
