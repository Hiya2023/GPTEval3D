Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model shows a spherical object on a clearly defined square nightstand, aligning with the prompt; the right model appears less clear in shape and does not distinctly match the description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural with clear proportions; the right has irregularities and less clear structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better alignment between shape and texture; the right model's texture is not well-defined against its geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer details, with clearer textures, while the right appears blurry and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more organized and efficient geometry with smooth details; the right model shows less coherent structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model consistently matches all criteria more effectively.
The left one is better.
