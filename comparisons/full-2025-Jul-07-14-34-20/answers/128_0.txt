Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears to capture a vague rectangular shape, resembling a sofa, while the right object shows irregular holes and does not resemble a stool or sofa. The left object is better aligned with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a more coherent shape resembling a plausible 3D object with identifiable flat surfaces; the right model has unnatural holes and appears noisy. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left object match its geometric form better than the right one, which has a less coherent texture aligning with its shape. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clearer and more defined textures compared to the very noisy patterns on the right. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The geometry of the left object is more organized and smooth, while the right object has chaotic and noisy details. The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all criteria, the left model is clearly better in terms of alignment, plausibility, and detail.
