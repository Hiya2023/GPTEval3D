Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a piece of furniture, perhaps a chair or table, which does not align with the prompt of "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - The right one shows a different object, also not matching the prompt, resembling a stylized bench or planter with texture, which still does not represent a globe on a pedestal.
   
Neither accurately reflects the text prompt description.

Final answer:
