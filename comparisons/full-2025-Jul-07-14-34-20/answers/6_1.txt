Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is less clear with no distinct triangular sign features; The right one clearly represents a triangular road sign.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has inconsistent shapes; The right one appears more structurally sound and logical.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has misaligned textures; The right one has better alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows blurriness; The right one maintains clearer details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is noisy; The right one has more defined geometrical details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model fulfills all criteria effectively.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
