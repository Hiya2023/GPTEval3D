Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is more like a diamond shape rather than a true triangle, not perfectly aligning with the prompt definition as "triangular". 
   - The right one accurately represents a triangular shape, aligning well with the prompt. 
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears solid but slightly misaligned with reality due to its shape.
   - The right one appears more natural and plausible as a road sign, given its shape and alignment. 
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one's texture aligns somewhat with the shape but doesn't fully convey a triangular road sign.
   - The right one's texture and geometry work well together, demonstrating a clear triangle sign. 
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one has visible but not very sharp texture details.
   - The right one exhibits clearer and more defined textures that appear less blurry.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one's geometry is fairly simple, lacking intricate details.
   - The right one has more defined geometry, aligning well with its intended shape. 
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: 
   The right object aligns better with all aspects: text prompt, 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, texture details, and geometry details.
   The right one is better.
