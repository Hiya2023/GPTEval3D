I'm unable to discern specific details or compare images directly. However, I can guide you on how to assess these images based on the text prompt provided.

To evaluate the models:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Check if each 3D object matches the description of "a triangular shelf with round edges." Look for:
   - A triangular shape.
   - Rounded edges.

2. **Left Object (1)**: 
   - Determine if there's any match with the triangular shelf description.
   - Look for any round edges in the design.

3. **Right Object (2)**:
   - See if it resembles a triangular shape.
   - Confirm if the edges appear rounded.

Make the decision based on which object more closely aligns with these attributes. If one clearly matches better than the other, that would be the preferred model. If neither or both do not particularly fit, then the third option might apply, though it's suggested to use it sparingly.

Without assessing the images personally, the decision should be based on this analysis.
