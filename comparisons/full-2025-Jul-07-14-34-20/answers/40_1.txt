Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model doesn't look like a spherical doorknob due to its intricate design; the right model embodies the simplicity and roundness of a knob more accurately.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model, while detailed, appears less like a practical doorknob. The right model has realistic proportions and a solid, spherical shape.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows more complexity in texture but doesn't align well with simple geometry, while the right one aligns texture and shape more effectively.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has intricate textures, but they aren't fitting for a simple doorknob; the right model's textures are straightforward, aligning with the prompt.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more distinct geometric details, but not in a way that represents the prompt. The right model, while simpler, represents the spherical shape effectively.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model consistently aligns better with the prompt of a "spherical doorknob."
The right one is better.
