Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more abstract and does not clearly depict a spherical lamp on a square nightstand. 
   - The right one shows an object resembling furniture, such as a sofa, which is not aligned with the prompt. 
   The right one is better at translating the general idea of furniture but neither captures the prompt accurately.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has irregular shapes with unclear structure, making it less plausible.
   - The right one appears more solid and structured like furniture, which is more plausible.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows noisy textures without much detail or clarity.
   - The right one has more detailed and realistic textures resembling fabric and wood.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
