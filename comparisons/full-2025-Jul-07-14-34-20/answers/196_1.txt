Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model is more aligned with the text prompt of a "square coffee table." It has a clear square shape and appropriate proportions.
   - The right model has some irregularities and doesn't clearly resemble a square table.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and plausible with no apparent irregularities in design.
   - The right model has noticeable distortions that affect its plausibility.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture aligns well with its geometry, reflecting the structure of a square table.
   - The right model displays misalignment between texture and geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model captures finer textures more accurately, with less noise.
   - The right model's textures appear overly abstract and noisy.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model's geometry is clean and well-represented.
   - The right model has excessive noise and lacks coherent details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model consistently performs better across all criteria.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
