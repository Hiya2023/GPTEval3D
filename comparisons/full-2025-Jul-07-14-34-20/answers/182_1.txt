Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one presents a table, but it’s not clearly square due to irregular edges.
   - The right one is more clearly square and aligns better with the prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has disproportionate features and floating textures.
   - The right one appears more solid and well-structured.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one’s textures do not align well with its geometry.
   - The right one shows better texture alignment with its structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one has somewhat blurry textures lacking detail.
   - The right one has clearer, more detailed textures.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one has noisy geometry with irregular shapes.
   - The right one presents a smoother and more organized structure.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: 
   - The right one consistently aligns better with all criteria.
   The right one is better.
