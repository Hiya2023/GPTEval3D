Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears as a simple, round, textured cushion which aligns well with the prompt "A round cushion".
   - The right model also seems round but features a patterned texture that adds complexity not mentioned in the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model is solid and plausible for a cushion, with no strange anomalies or duplicated parts.
   - The right model appears solid but the intricate pattern may introduce a perception of less structural normalcy for a simple object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a uniform, soft-looking texture suitable for a cushion but lacks intricate detail.
   - The right model features a detailed pattern with clear, sharp textures that are more visually elaborate.
   - The right one is better.
