Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one consists of a sofa and a table, while the right one consists of a single couch-like structure. Neither corresponds to the prompt "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal." 
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object features multiple pieces which resemble real-world furniture, while the right object is more ambiguous and less discernible.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures align well with their geometry, providing distinct identifiable parts, while the right object lacks clear definition.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object's textures appear more detailed and clear compared to the relatively uniform and less distinct textures on the right.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is more intricate and discernible compared to the simpler, less detailed geometry of the right.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object displays better detail, alignment, and plausibility considering all degrees compared to the right, which lacks the proper elements of the text prompt and detail.
   The left one is better.
