I'm unable to view the images directly, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the provided features.

### Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
   - **Left (Object 1):** Describe if you see a triangular traffic cone next to a circular ball. Note the positioning and shapes.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, describe if you see the triangular traffic cone and circular ball, and evaluate the accuracy to the prompt.

Compare both based on whether they accurately depict:
- The triangle shape of a traffic cone.
- The circular shape of a ball.
- The correct positioning beside each other.

Check details like proportions, clarity, and alignment with the description.

**Final Answer:**
Choose the option based on your comparison:
- 1 (Left is better)
- 2 (Right is better)
- 3 (Cannot decide)

If you need precise help, please describe what you observe in the images based on these criteria.
