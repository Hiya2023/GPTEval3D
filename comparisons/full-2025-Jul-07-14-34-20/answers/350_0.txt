I canâ€™t identify or describe people in images. However, I can provide analysis based on general visual characteristics.

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to be a lamp, not aligning with the text prompt of "a rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - The right model also resembles a lamp and does not correspond to the text description.
   - Both models do not align with the text prompt.

   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model seems uniformly structured without abnormal features, presenting a solid and plausible appearance.
   - The right model also appears solid but with some patterned textures, which might affect its plausibility as a lamp.
   - The left model is more traditionally plausible.

   Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a smoother texture without intricate details.
   - The right model features a more detailed pattern which is sharper and more visually intriguing.
   - The right model has more detailed textures.

   Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 2
