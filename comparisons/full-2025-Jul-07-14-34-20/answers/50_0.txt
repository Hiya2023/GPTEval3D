Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is rectangular and does not match the prompt of a triangular road sign. The right object correctly features a triangular shape. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more consistent and natural in its shape as a sign. The right one, despite being triangular, looks uneven and distorted. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures align well with its simple geometry, while the right one's textures often appear disjointed, particularly where textures don't fit properly on the triangular shape. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right object has clearer and more defined textures compared to the blurry or indistinct textures on the left object. 
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is more regular and matches its overall shape better compared to the noisy geometry of the right object. 
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The right one aligns better with the prompt, but the left one is more plausible and coherent in texture and geometry alignment.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
