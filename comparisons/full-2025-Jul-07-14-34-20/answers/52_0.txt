Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: Both models resemble a trapezoidal bookshelf, but the right one appears more accurately aligned in terms of structure. The left model looks rounder and less like a trapezoid.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural with better-defined edges and proportions. The right model looks a bit distorted.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures generally align better with the geometry in the left model, as the structure is clearer both in RGB and normal maps.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: Both models have decent texture detail, but the left model captures more intricate wood detailing that aligns with a bookshelf aesthetic.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a smoother and more organized structure with finer geometry details visible in the normal map.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model captures the design more effectively.
The left one is better.
