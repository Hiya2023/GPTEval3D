Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one deviates significantly with a textured, non-cushion appearance; the right one accurately represents a round cushion.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one is irregular and complex; the right one is simple and cushion-like.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has mismatched textures and geometry; the right one shows better alignment between shape and texture.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one's textures are chaotic; the right one maintains cohesive and consistent texture details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits excessive noise; the right one has smoother, more structured detail consistent with a cushion.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right model aligns better with the prompt and exhibits superior quality across criteria.
   The right one is better.
