I'm unable to provide a detailed analysis of the multi-view images without viewing them directly. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them according to the provided criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - **Left (object 1):** Check if it includes both a triangular traffic cone and a circular ball. Evaluate the resemblance to these objects.
   - **Right (object 2):** Similarly, ensure it has the traffic cone and ball as described.
   - Decision: Choose the one that accurately portrays both objects according to the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (object 1):** Look for natural proportions and absence of any duplicated or unusual features.
   - **Right (object 2):** Evaluate for realistic shapes and solid appearance.
   - Decision: Select the one appearing more plausible and natural.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - **Left (object 1):** Check the texture pattern aligned with the geometry in the RGB and normal maps.
   - **Right (object 2):** Ensure the texture adheres to its shape.
   - Decision: Choose the model with better alignment between texture and shape.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - **Left (object 1):** Assess for clarity and detail in textures.
   - **Right (object 2):** Evaluate the texture precision.
   - Decision: Pick the one that maintains fine details.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - **Left (object 1):** Notice the intricacy and organization in normal maps.
   - **Right (object 2):** Check for well-defined and structured details.
   - Decision: Select based on better geometry detail representation.

6. **Overall Decision:**
   - Combine the evaluations from each criterion to make a comprehensive choice.

### Final Answer:

Provide your decision based on these criteria in the format of options from 1, 2, or 3 for each of the six criteria. For example, "1 2 1 1 2 1" or "2 1 2 1 1 2".
