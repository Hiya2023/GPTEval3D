I'm unable to view the images or compare them directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach the evaluation based on the provided criteria. Here's how you can analyze and compare the two models based on the evaluation criteria:

### Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Check both models for the presence of a rectangular sofa and an oval mirror.
   - Evaluate which model better captures the described objects and their relative positions.
   - Decide based on how closely each model aligns with the text description.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Examine how natural and plausible each model looks considering the RGB and normal maps.
   - Look for proper proportions and realistic structures.
   - Identify and compare any abnormalities or irregularities.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - Assess how well the texture maps onto the geometry for both models.
   - Determine if the textures correspond well to the shapes as shown in the normal maps.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Focus on the clarity and detail of textures on both models.
   - Decide which model captures finer details effectively without blurriness.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - Examine the level of detail in the normal maps.
   - Identify which model has more precise and pleasing geometric details.

6. **Overall**:
   - Consider all the above factors collectively to decide which model performs better.

### Final Output Format:
Based on your detailed evaluation, fill in the output in this form:

```
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

6. Overall, xxxxxx
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

Final answer:
x x x x x x
```

By following this structured evaluation, you'll be able to provide a comprehensive comparison of the two 3D models.
