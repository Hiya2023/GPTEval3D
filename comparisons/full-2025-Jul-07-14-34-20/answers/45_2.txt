Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears to be two spherical doorknobs side by side, but lacks detail; the right object is more consistent with a single spherical doorknob with attaching parts. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object seems less solid and less natural; the right object looks more like a plausible doorknob with proper structure and detail. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object’s texture doesn’t match the geometry closely; the right has better alignment between geometric shape and texture, especially where the knob attaches. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object lacks texture detail; the right object has visible texture, although slightly noisy, but still more defined. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object is smooth but lacks detail; the right object shows more defined geometric details even if slightly noisy. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one exhibits better alignment with the prompt and detailed textures and geometry. The right one is better.
