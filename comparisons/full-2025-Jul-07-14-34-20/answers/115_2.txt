Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not resemble a cylindrical vase; the right one has a more cylindrical shape. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks a coherent shape; the right one appears more structured and plausible. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has poor alignment; the right one shows better correspondence between texture and shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is very abstract and lacks detail; the right one has more defined textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has noisy and unclear geometry; the right one shows clearer and organized details. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one aligns better with the prompt and exhibits better plausibility and detail. The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
