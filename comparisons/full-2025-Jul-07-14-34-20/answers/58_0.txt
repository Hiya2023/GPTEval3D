Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left model appears nondescript and lacks clear identifiable features like cylindrical armrests.
   - The right model clearly depicts a sofa with discernible cylindrical armrests and a rectangular shape.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks noisy and less defined, lacking a solid structure.
   - The right model appears more natural and realistic in its shape and solidity.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture is chaotic and does not align well with the shape.
   - The right model's texture adheres well to the visible geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left modelâ€™s textures are noisy and lack detail.
   - The right model shows clearer and more defined texture details.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has chaotic and noisy geometry.
   - The right model possesses smoother and more coherent geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right model consistently performs better across all criteria, accurately representing the text prompt and demonstrating superior plausibility, texture alignment, and detail.
   - The right one is better.
