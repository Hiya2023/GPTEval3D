Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears elliptical with circular legs, aligning well with the text prompt.
   - The right one is also elliptical with circular legs, matching the description well.
   - Cannot decide which matches the prompt better since both fit the description equally.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has some irregularities in shape and surface.
   - The right one appears more stable and realistic with consistent leg shapes and surface.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a less detailed and somewhat blurred texture.
   - The right one has sharper, more realistic textures with visible wood grain.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
