I'm unable to analyze the specific content of these images directly, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the given instructions.

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - Evaluate how well each model corresponds to "a hexagonal mirror with a triangular frame."
   - **Left:** Describe the features and note alignment with the text prompt.
   - **Right:** Describe the features and note alignment with the text prompt.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Consider the natural appearance, solidity, and plausibility of the models.
   - **Left:** Note any irregularities or solid features.
   - **Right:** Note any irregularities or solid features.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Assess if the texture aligns well with the geometry in both RGB and normal images.
   - **Left:** Comment on the alignment quality.
   - **Right:** Comment on the alignment quality.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Check for fine details and clarity in local parts of the RGB images.
   - **Left:** Note the detail quality.
   - **Right:** Note the detail quality.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Evaluate the accuracy and organization of the geometry from normal maps.
   - **Left:** Observe the structural details.
   - **Right:** Observe the structural details.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

6. **Overall:**
   - Considering all above aspects, decide which model is better.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

### Final Answer:
Fill in your decisions for each criterion here, e.g., "1 2 2 3 2 1" based on your analysis.
