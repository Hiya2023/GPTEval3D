Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left sofa reflects the rectangular shape but lacks cylindrical armrests.
   - The right sofa has both rectangular shape and cylindrical armrests.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left sofa seems more solid and plausible, appearing natural.
   - The right sofa has abnormal textures which disrupt its realism.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left sofa's texture doesn’t align well with the geometry.
   - The right sofa's texture and geometry align better, notably at the armrests.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left sofa's texture appears plain and lacking detail.
   - The right sofa’s detailed stripes enhance texture richness.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left sofa's geometry lacks intricate details.
   - The right sofa displays more defined geometrical details.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering both design alignment and detail quality, the right one captures more of the desired attributes.
   - The right one is better.
