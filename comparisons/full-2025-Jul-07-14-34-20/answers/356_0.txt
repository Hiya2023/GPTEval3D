Analyzing the provided images, I will evaluate them based on the specified criteria:

Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The model does not appear to have a clear conical shape and cylindrical base. The form is ambiguous and doesnâ€™t align well with the prompt of "a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base."
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The model shows some aspects of a conical shape and appears to have a more defined structure which loosely aligns with the description of a conical lampshade.

   The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The structure seems fragmented and lacks a coherent 3D form. There are visible irregularities and it appears less plausible as a solid object.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The structure looks more normal and plausible. While not perfect, it maintains a more cohesive and solid appearance as a 3D model.

   The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The texture is not clear and lacks detail, contributing to a less realistic appearance.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The texture is sharper and shows more detail, providing a more realistic and defined look.

   The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
