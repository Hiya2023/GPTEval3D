Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears as a rounded, possibly spherical chair, with no clear triangular shape.
   - The right one also doesn't resemble a triangular shelf but seems more like a rounded bowl or seat.
   - Both models do not align well with the text prompt of a "triangular shelf with round edges," but neither is closer to the description.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a solid and plausible spherical chair, with clear structural features such as a base and what seems to be cushioning.
   - The right one appears less structured and more abstract, lacking definition which contributes to a less plausible 3D representation.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a brighter, more defined texture, with evident details such as a mesh-like surface.
   - The right one has a more muted texture with less detail and sharpness.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
