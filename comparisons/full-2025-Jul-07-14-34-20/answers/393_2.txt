Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a rectangular sofa with visible cylindrical armrests and a detailed cushion structure.
   - The right one is also a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests, matching the prompt closely.
   - Comparison: The left one aligns well with the prompt, but the right one offers a clearer representation.
   - Decision: Right (object 2) is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears structurally solid but has a less natural flow in the normal maps.
   - The right one seems more coherent as a 3D model, with smooth contours.
   - Decision: Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has visible texture details that are somewhat sharper and more pronounced.
   - The right one, while vivid, lacks some texture sharpness and detail.
   - Decision: Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
2 2 1
