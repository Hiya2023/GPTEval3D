Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles an intricate object, possibly with multiple components, but does not match the prompt of "A spherical lamp on a square nightstand."
   - The right one resembles a sofa, which also does not align with the text prompt.
   - Cannot decide. Both fail to align with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears irregular and fragmented, lacking a coherent, solid structure.
   - The right one is more cohesive, resembling a plausible piece of furniture.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has inconsistent textures that are not very clear or detailed.
   - The right one exhibits more consistent and detailed texture, especially in color variance and pattern.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
