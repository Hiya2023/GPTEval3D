Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one and right one both fail to represent a circular clock above a cuboid bookshelf; Neither model reflects the prompt accurately.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid, with a more plausible structure, while the right one looks like a flat object with no clear depth.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows a more consistent alignment between geometry and texture, while the right one has mismatches.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has better texture details that are clear; the right one appears more abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more organized geometry without noise, whereas the right one is less organized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more coherent in structure and texture, despite neither matching the prompt well.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1 1 1 1
