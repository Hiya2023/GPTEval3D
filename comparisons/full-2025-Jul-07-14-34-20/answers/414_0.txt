Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model looks like an elliptical table with circular legs, matching the text prompt well.
   - The right model has a round top and more ornate legs, which doesn't align as closely with an "elliptical" table.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid and plausible, with appropriate structure and no apparent issues.
   - The right model looks less stable or realistic, with legs that seem less structurally sound.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a more polished, consistent texture, albeit slightly blurred.
   - The right model seems to have more detailed textures, particularly on the top surface.
   - The right one is better.
