I'm unable to evaluate the detailed multi-view images of the 3D objects directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach the analysis using the criteria provided:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - **Left Object**: Does the object match the "spherical chair with a flat seat" prompt? Consider its shape and features.
   - **Right Object**: Similarly, evaluate if this object corresponds to the text prompt.
   - Conclusion: Decide which model better fulfills the description.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - **Left Object**: Assess if the model appears normal and solid without any strange or misplaced parts.
   - **Right Object**: Evaluate this object for plausibility in its 3D construction.
   - Conclusion: Select the more plausible model.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left Object**: Examine the detail, sharpness, and realism of textures.
   - **Right Object**: Similarly review the texture quality of this model.
   - Conclusion: Determine which has superior textures.

Finally, use the evidence you've gathered to choose one of the three options for each criterion and summarize your decision.
