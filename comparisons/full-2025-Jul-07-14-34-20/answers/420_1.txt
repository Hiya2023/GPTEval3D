Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object is a triangular shape on a pole, resembling a road sign.
   - The right object has a clearer triangular shape with patterns and a striped pole.
   - The right one is better; it aligns more closely with the idea of a "triangular road sign."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid but simple in design.
   - The right object looks structurally more complex and realistic, with clear edges and a detailed pole.
   - The right one is better; it appears more plausible as a 3D object.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a rough, less detailed texture.
   - The right object displays sharper and more detailed textures, especially on the pole.
   - The right one is better; its textures are sharper and more detailed.

Final answer:
