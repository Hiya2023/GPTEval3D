Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a sofa with pillows on a small pedestal, which does not align with the prompt of "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - The right object seems to have more distinct pedestal-like elements but appears more like abstract art rather than the prompt description.
   - Cannot decide which aligns better due to both deviating significantly from the original description.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object looks like an identifiable piece of furniture and appears more solid and coherent.
   - The right object has unusual shapes that make the structure seem less plausible and cohesive.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object's textures are soft with some detail, resembling fabric.
   - The right object has colorful but less distinct textures.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
