Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object accurately displays a rectangular sofa with visible cylindrical armrests, matching the prompt closely.
   - The right object has a generally rectangular shape but lacks discernible details for the armrests.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears more solid and well-structured, resembling a real sofa with clear proportions.
   - The right object lacks definition and has indistinct features.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object has textures that adhere well to the sofa's shape, especially noticeable in the armrests.
   - The right object shows poor alignment between texture and geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures fine details, showing a more realistic texture pattern suitable for a sofa.
   - The right object appears blurry with less detail.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows clear and defined geometry without excessive noise.
   - The right object is less organized and lacks intricate detail.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the left object is consistently better in alignment with the text prompt, 3D plausibility, texture alignment, and detail quality.
   - The left one is better.
