Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model resembles a curved sofa with vague cushion shapes and doesn't align well with the text prompt "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal".
   - The right model shows a sofa and a table, also not corresponding to the description.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model seems incomplete with unclear structures.
   - The right model appears more complete and coherent with distinct sofa and table parts.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has soft, less defined textures.
   - The right model displays sharper textures and more detailed patterns.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
