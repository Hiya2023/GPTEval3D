Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has an oval top that matches the description more closely, while the right appears more circular.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more stable and realistically structured. The right model has visible noise and less defined support structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model shows consistent texture alignment with the geometry. The right model has misaligned textures, especially noticeable around the tabletop.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model captures textures clearly, while the right appears to have a blurry and noisy texture.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has more precise geometry details, especially visible in the base structure. The right model shows noisy geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model adheres better to the prompt across all criteria.
   - The left one is better.
