Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to show a sofa-like object with a lot of irregularities and does not resemble a spherical lamp on a square nightstand.
   - The right one also looks more like a sofa but with better definition in terms of structure, however, it still doesn't correspond to the prompt.
   - Cannot decide. Both do not align well with the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a more solid appearance but many undefined and irregular structures.
   - The right one has a slightly clearer definition with distinct legs, although it still has some irregular shapes.
   - Right (object 2) is better; it appears a bit more plausible as a cohesive structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a somewhat refined texture but is mostly uniform without detail.
   - The right one exhibits more distinction in parts and colors, offering slightly more detail.
   - Right (object 2) is better; it has more texture details.

Final answer:
3 2 2
