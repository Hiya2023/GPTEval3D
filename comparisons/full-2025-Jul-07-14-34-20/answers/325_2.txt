Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be more rounded rather than strictly oval and might not fully align with the "oval" description.
   - The right one clearly shows an oval shape that corresponds with "oval dining table."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks stable but has an unusual base design that might be less practical or plausible.
   - The right one appears more traditional and plausible with realistic proportions and leg design.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one seems to have a more blurred and less detailed texture.
   - The right one has sharper texture details that are more realistic and defined.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
