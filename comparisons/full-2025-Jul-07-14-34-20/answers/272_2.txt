I'm unable to identify or describe people from images. However, I can help analyze 3D objects.

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (object 1): This object does not resemble a triangular shelf and has a rounded, chair-like appearance.
   - Right (object 2): This object also does not resemble a triangular shelf. It has a rounded, chair-like shape.

Neither object resembles a "triangular shelf with round edges" as per the text prompt. Both objects appear to be more spherical and resemble chairs rather than shelves.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
