Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: The table is elliptical with circular legs, though the texture may distract from the shape clarity. 
   - **Right (object 2)**: Clearly elliptical with circular legs, matching the prompt well.
   
   The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: Appears solid, but the texture seems noisy and could suggest a strange body.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Looks more solid and normal with fewer structural anomalies.
   
   The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: The texture is vibrant and detailed but chaotic and less realistic.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Texture is more subdued and generally lacks sharpness and detail.
   
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
