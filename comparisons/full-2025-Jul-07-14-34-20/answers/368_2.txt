I'm unable to view detailed aspects of the images, but I can guide you on how to analyze them based on the criteria you've provided. Here's how you might approach it:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate if the shape appears spherical with a distinguishable flat seat.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Evaluate the same attributes.
   - Determine which object aligns better with "A spherical chair with a flat seat."

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Consider if the object looks solid, normal, and plausible in 3D form. Check for strange bodies or duplicated parts.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Perform the same evaluation.
   - Decide which object appears more plausible as a 3D model.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Focus on sharpness, realism, and detail of textures in the RGB images.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Perform the same evaluation.
   - Determine which object has superior texture details.

### Final answer:
- After evaluating each point, choose which object better fulfills each criterion. The final decision should be in the format: `<option for criterion 1> <option for criterion 2> <option for criterion 3>`.
  
For example, if Object 1 aligns better with the text, Object 2 is more plausible, and Object 2 has better texture, you would write: `1 2 2`.

Feel free to fill in your observations as per the actual analysis.
