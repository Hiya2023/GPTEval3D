Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left: Complex with additional features not typical of a doorknob, more ornamental.
   - Right: Simpler and more spherical, closely aligned with "a spherical doorknob."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: Appears complex, possibly less natural due to added features.
   - Right: Simple, spherical, and structurally solid, matching real-world doorknobs.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - Left: Texture is intricate but may not align well with basic geometry.
   - Right: Texture aligns well with the simple, spherical geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - Left: Features detailed texture but may overwhelm simple form.
   - Right: Maintains clarity with its minimalistic style, more appropriate for the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - Left: Complex geometry adds unnecessary detail.
   - Right: Presents a clean, effective spherical geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one is consistently more aligned with the prompt and exhibits better structural plausibility.
   - The right one is better.
