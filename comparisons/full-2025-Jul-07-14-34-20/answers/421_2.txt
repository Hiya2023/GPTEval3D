I'm unable to provide a decision based on the content of the images. However, I can assist with guidelines for evaluating text prompt alignment, 3D plausibility, and texture sharpness:

**1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:** 
   - Describe each object.
   - Evaluate how well each object corresponds to the attributes in the text prompt "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."

**2. 3D Plausibility:**
   - Consider if the objects appear solid and plausible.
   - Look for any strange body problems, duplicated parts, or meaningless structures.

**3. Low-Level Texture:**
   - Focus on the sharpness, realism, and detail of textures in the objects.

You can use these guidelines to compare and decide which object better meets each criterion.
