I'm unable to directly view or analyze images, but I can help guide you on how to approach this comparison based on the criteria you've provided.

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Describe this object based on its features (e.g., shape, edges, etc.). Check if it resembles a triangular shelf with round edges.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Describe this object similarly and compare it to the prompt.
   - **Decision:** Decide which object aligns better with the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Consider how normal and solid the model appears, checking for any strange structures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Evaluate its solidity and presence of unnecessary parts.
   - **Decision:** Choose which is more plausible.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Focus on the texture details and sharpness.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Examine texture realism and detailing.
   - **Decision:** Choose which has better texture detail.

**Final answer:**
Decide your evaluation for each criterion and present it in the format:
"1 2 2" or similar based on your observations.
