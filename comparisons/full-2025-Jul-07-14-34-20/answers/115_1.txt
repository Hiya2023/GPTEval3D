Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object does not clearly resemble a cylindrical vase, while the right one maintains a more cylindrical form. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has irregular protrusions and lacks a plausible structure; the right one appears more natural. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows poor alignment between geometry and texture; the right one has a more consistent alignment. 
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object appears blurry with less defined textures; the right one captures fine details more effectively. 
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has noisy and confusing geometry; the right one presents more organized and intricate details. 
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object better represents a cylindrical vase with plausible and consistent details.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
