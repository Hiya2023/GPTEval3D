Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a simpler design that matches the basic idea of a "square coffee table." The right one includes ornate legs not mentioned in the prompt. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has simpler, more stable proportions. The right one appears less natural due to the intricate design, which might not align with a typical coffee table.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has a more consistent texture that aligns well with its geometry. The right one has a mismatch between its ornate textures and the geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows finer texture details without becoming abstract. The right oneâ€™s texture is busy and less consistent.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a smooth, well-organized structure. The right one is overly complex and less coherent in the context of a coffee table.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one aligns more closely with the prompt, is more natural, and has better texture and geometry alignment.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
