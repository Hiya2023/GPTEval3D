Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model resembles a spherical form typical of a doorknob, while the right model maintains a spherical shape but has additional texture effects that may slightly deviate from a typical doorknob appearance. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and solid, maintaining consistent spherical proportions. The right model, while spherical, includes texture artifacts that can detract from its plausibility as a solid object.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows more consistent texture alignment with the spherical geometry. The right model's textures are less aligned, creating mismatched areas.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model’s textures are smooth and more uniform, fitting the description of a doorknob better. The right model’s textures have variations that are less realistic for a spherical doorknob.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model maintains a cleaner and more precise spherical shape with its normal maps, whereas the right model introduces unnecessary aberrations.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model consistently adheres better to the criteria and represents the prompt of a spherical doorknob more accurately and plausibly.
The left one is better.
