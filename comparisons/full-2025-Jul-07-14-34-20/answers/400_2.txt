Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a vase or decorative object with a vibrant floral texture, which does not align with the text prompt "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - The right one looks like a lamp with a shade, which also does not match the text prompt.
   
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a cohesive shape that is consistent, resembling a vase with floral patterns.
   - The right one is a plausible depiction of a lamp with a solid structure and clear lamp base and shade.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more detailed and colorful floral textures, which are sharp and vibrant.
   - The right one has simpler textures with less detail compared to the left.
   
   The left one is better.
