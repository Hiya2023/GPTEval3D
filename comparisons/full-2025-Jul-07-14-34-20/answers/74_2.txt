Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has extra details not typical of a spherical doorknob, while the right model is simple and matches a spherical shape. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has irregularities and non-spherical features; the right model looks solid and spherical, as expected for a doorknob.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture does not align with its form, while the right model's texture wraps naturally around its shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has excessive abstract details; the right model maintains a simple, clean aesthetic.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left modelâ€™s geometry has unnecessary complexity; the right model is smooth and simple.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model consistently aligns with the prompt and exhibits better fidelity across criteria.
The right one is better.
