Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a small spherical object with a smooth surface, resembling a generic sphere but not clearly a doorknob.
   - The right one shows an object with a clearer doorknob form, including a base where it connects to a door.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears as a simple sphere with no additional features.
   - The right one has a more detailed form, with a base that adds to its doorknob appearance.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one has a consistent smooth texture over the sphere.
   - The right one has a more complex texture, which aligns better with its geometry to depict a doorknob.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one is smooth with minimal texture details.
   - The right one exhibits more detailed textures, resembling real-world materials.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one shows minimal geometric detail.
   - The right one has intricate details around the base and sphere, enhancing its realism as a doorknob.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right one effectively captures the spherical doorknob prompt with better structure, texture, and detail.
   - The right one is better.
