I'm unable to directly interpret image content but I'm here to help you with the analysis approach! To evaluate the models based on the text prompt "A spherical chair with a flat seat," focus on the following aspects:

1. **Shape and Form**: Analyze whether the objects resemble a sphere for the body and have a clear, flat seat.

2. **Surface Texture and Normal Maps**: Check if the textures and surface details are consistent with what a chair might have, smooth where needed, and indicative of seating comfort.

By comparing the left and right sides based on these criteria, you should be able to determine which object better aligns with the prompt. Feel free to describe your observations, and I can help guide further analysis!
