   The right one is complex and more structured but still not natural.
   Right is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   The left one has minimal texture alignment.
   The right one shows better geometry-texture coherence.
   Right is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   The left one lacks detail and is blurry.
   The right one has more distinct textures.
   Right is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
