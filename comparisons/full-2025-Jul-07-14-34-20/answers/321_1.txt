Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to resemble a table with a hexagonal shape and legs that could resemble a support structure, aligning somewhat with the prompt description of "a hexagonal table under a round mirror."
   - The right object seems more cylindrical and resembles stacked discs or rings, which does not align well with the idea of a hexagonal table.
   - The left object is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has a more coherent and plausible structure resembling a table, with defined legs and a tabletop.
   - The right object appears unusual as a table, with repetitive stacked elements that do not form a typical table-like structure.
   - The left object is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a varied texture across the different parts, with some detail around the base and tabletop.
   - The right object has a repeated texture pattern on the surface, which is vibrant but less detailed.
   - The left object is better.
