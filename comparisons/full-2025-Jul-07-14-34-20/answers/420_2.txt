Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left object is a yellow triangular shape on a pole, which somewhat resembles a triangular road sign but lacks clarity and detail. 
   - The right object has a clear triangular shape with distinct colors that more distinctly resembles a road sign.
   - The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left object looks more solid and consistent as a model with no apparent strange structures.
   - The right object seems less solid and has unusual textures that may suggest issues in structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left object has a rough texture but lacks fine detail.
   - The right object shows more detailed coloring and textural variation.
   - The right one is better.
