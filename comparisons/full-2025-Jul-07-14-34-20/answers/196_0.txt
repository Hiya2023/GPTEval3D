Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is clearly more aligned with the description of a "square coffee table," having a more distinct square shape and table-like structure. The right one seems less defined and less aligned with the text prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural and solid, with a clearer table-like structure. The right one has irregularities and appears less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its geometry. The right model shows mismatched textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures finer details, while the right one appears more abstract and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents a more organized and efficient structure, capturing intricate details. The right one appears noisy and less refined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one shows more coherence and effectiveness as a 3D object of a square coffee table.
The left one is better.
