Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: The sofa appears rectangular with cylindrical armrests, aligning with the prompt.
   - The right one: The sofa also has a rectangular shape and cylindrical elements noticeable in the design.
   - The left one is better because it more clearly exhibits the cylindrical armrests as part of the sofa's main form.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: The model looks solid with no apparent strange body issues or duplicated parts.
   - The right one: The model seems plausible but has some structural elements that make it appear less coherent.
   - The left one is better as it appears more normal and solid without unusual structures.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: The texture is smooth but lacks detailed sharpness.
   - The right one: The texture is more detailed and complex, offering a realistic look.
   - The right one is better for sharper and more realistic texture details.
