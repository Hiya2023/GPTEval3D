Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a spherical shape and seems to have an attachment that resembles a doorknob backing.
   - The right one is clearly spherical with a base, resembling a classic doorknob design.
   - The right one is better as it more accurately represents "a spherical doorknob."

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has some unusual features that could be interpreted as noisy or extraneous, possibly affecting the solidity and realism.
   - The right one appears more structured and plausible, with a consistent shape and no visible strange features.
   - The right one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has visible noise in its texture which may detract from realism.
   - The right one has a smoother and more consistent texture, which appears sharper and more realistic.
   - The right one is better for low-level texture.
