Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model is a clear, identifiable square coffee table; the right model is distorted and less recognizable. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears solid and realistic; the right model has irregular, implausible structures.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s texture aligns well with the shape; the right model shows misalignment with distorted geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model displays clearer, more defined textures; the right model is noisy and lacks clarity.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has smooth, coherent geometry; the right model is chaotic and noisy.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more aligned with the prompt and exhibits better structure and texture alignment.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
