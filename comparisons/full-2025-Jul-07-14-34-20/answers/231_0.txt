I'm unable to view specific aspects of images regarding detailed textural and structural analysis of 3D objects. However, I can infer general guidance for evaluating and comparing such images. Based on the task description, here's how you might go about analyzing the images:

### Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**:
     - The object appears to be a cylinder, which does not align with the prompt of a "hexagonal table."
     - No mirror is visible in the multi-view images.
   
   - **Right (Object 2)**:
     - The object depicts a table-like structure, possibly hexagonal, aligning more closely with the prompt.
     - The top view might suggest a more round or slightly irregular shape, but it appears to capture the table aspect better.
     - There is still no evidence of a mirror.

Overall, **Right (Object 2)** captures the essence of a table under a mirror more effectively than **Left (Object 1)**, considering the given text prompt.

### Final answer:
2 (Right is better)
