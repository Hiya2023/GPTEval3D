Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have a circular top and a circular base, which does not fully align with the "square base" aspect of the prompt.
   - The right object also seems to have a circular top, but the base is more elaborate and could suggest some square elements in its detailing or texture.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and typical of a stool design, with no apparent distortions or duplicate parts.
   - The right object has a more complex structure that might make it feel less solid and more prone to strange geometry, but it remains overall plausible.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture is basic and lacks detail, appearing smooth and without intricate features.
   - The right object's texture is sharper and more detailed, offering a richer visual experience.
   - The right one is better.
