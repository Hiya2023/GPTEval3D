Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears more like a collection of abstract shapes instead of a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal.
   - The right object, while colorful, does not resemble a globe or a pedestal either.
   - Cannot decide which better aligns with the prompt as neither represents it well.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems to have a more solid, albeit abstract, form. It lacks any excessive strange parts.
   - The right object appears more chaotic with less coherent structure and seems less plausible as a distinct 3D object.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a smoother, more subtle texture, which is not very detailed.
   - The right object has a more detailed texture with vivid colors and patterns.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 2
