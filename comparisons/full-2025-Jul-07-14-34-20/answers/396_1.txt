Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model has an elliptical shape with circular legs, aligning well with the prompt.
   - The right model also has an elliptical shape, but the legs appear less distinct in their circular form.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and coherent, with clear boundaries and structure.
   - The right model, while plausible, looks somewhat less defined and is slightly shadowy.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a more defined texture, with clearer details and contrast.
   - The right model's texture seems less sharp and detailed.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
