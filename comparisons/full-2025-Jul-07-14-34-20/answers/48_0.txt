Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object captures intricate details, but it's not strictly spherical. 
   - The right object is more spherical, fitting the "spherical doorknob" description better.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object looks complex and detailed but isn't as natural for a doorknob.
   - The right object appears more natural and plausible as a doorknob with appropriate proportions.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object shows complex textures, but the alignment seems off with geometric features.
   - The right object has a more consistent alignment between the texture and geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has more detailed textures, but they are overly complex for the prompt.
   - The right object's textures are simpler and more fitting for a doorknob.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has intricate geometry but not relevant for a simple spherical shape.
   - The right object has cleaner, efficient geometry appropriate for a spherical shape.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right object aligns better with the prompt and provides a more plausible representation.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
