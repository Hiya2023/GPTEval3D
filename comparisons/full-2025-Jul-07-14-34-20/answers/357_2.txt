I'm unable to display or analyze images directly, but I can help you with how to conduct a comparison based on your criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate whether the object appears spherical and resembles a doorknob. Consider the proportions and features.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Similarly, check if this object adheres to the spherical doorknob description.
   - Better alignment: Decide which of the two better represents a "spherical doorknob."

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Assess for normal and solid appearance, checking for anatomical accuracy and coherence in structure. Look out for any irregularities or inconsistencies.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Evaluate similarly for three-dimensional plausibility.
   - More plausible model: Determine which object appears more structurally sound and logical.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Focus on the texture's sharpness, detail, and realism in the RGB images.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Analyze similarly for texture quality.
   - Better texture: Choose the model with more realistic and detailed textures.

### Final Decision:
- Based on your analysis, compare each aspect independently and summarize your final verdict in the format specified.

For example, if you find that:
- The left object better aligns with the text,
- The right object is more plausible,
- And the left object has sharper textures,
- Your final answer might be: `1 2 1`.
