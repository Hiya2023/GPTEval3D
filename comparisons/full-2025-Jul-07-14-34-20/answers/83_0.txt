Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one appears more like an undefined green shape rather than a round cushion.
   - The right one has a shape and texture resembling a round cushion.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has an irregular and unrealistic shape.
   - The right one has a plausible, solid, round cushion shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture does not align well with a cushion shape.
   - The right one's texture appears consistent with the cushion geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one's texture details are unclear and erratic.
   - The right one has finer, more realistic texture details for a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one lacks meaningful geometry details.
   - The right one shows more structured and appropriate geometry details for a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria, the right one reflects the description of a "round cushion" more accurately.
   - The right one is better.
