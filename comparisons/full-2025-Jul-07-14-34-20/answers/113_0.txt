Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features a lamp, not a sofa and mirror; the right model also features a lamp. Neither aligns with the prompt well. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left model appears more natural in shape and proportions; the right model appears less realistic due to its abstract texture background. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left model's texture aligns better with its geometry; the right model's texture is less clear and doesn't adhere well. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left model has clearer texture details, whereas the right one looks abstract. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left model appears more detailed in terms of geometry; the right model is simpler. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model accomplishes better alignment in terms of plausibility, alignment, and detail. The left one is better.
