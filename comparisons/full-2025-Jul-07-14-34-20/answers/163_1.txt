Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a circular top but lacks a square base, appearing more cylindrical; the right model also has a circular top with an unclear base shape. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more like a solid, natural stool form; the right model seems less stable. 
Left (object 1) is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s texture aligns reasonably well with its shape; the right model shows some misalignment in texture to shape.
Left (object 1) is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details more clearly without excessive blurriness; the right model appears overly textured and less clear.
Left (object 1) is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more organized and consistent geometry; the right model shows more irregularities.
Left (object 1) is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model outperforms the right model in multiple areas.
Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1 1 1 1
