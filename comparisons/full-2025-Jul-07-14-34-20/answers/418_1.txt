Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is an intricately designed cushion with a patterned texture and colored detailing, aligning less directly with "A round cushion."
   - The right one is a simple, round cushion that aligns closely with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears well-formed with clear detail and structure.
   - The right one also seems solid and plausible but lacks the detailed complexity.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one displays more intricate, sharper textures with detailed patterns.
   - The right one has a softer, less detailed texture.
   - The left one is better.
