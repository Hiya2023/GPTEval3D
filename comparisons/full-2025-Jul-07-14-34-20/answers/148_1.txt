Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears chaotic and does not clearly depict a round stool or a rectangular sofa. The right object more closely resembles a plausible single part of a rectilinear object, more aligned with the "rectangular sofa" aspect. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has an irregular and noisy structure, lacking clear definition. The right object presents more coherent and solid geometry.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture and geometry appear mismatched, with non-uniform distribution. The right object's texture is simpler but aligns better with its shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object is highly texturized but lacks clarity, whereas the right object is clearer and more defined in its simplicity.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object contains complex but disorganized details, while the right object has more coherent geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the aspects above, the right object demonstrates more alignment with a plausible 3D object.
The right one is better.
