Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one represents a triangular road sign with clear text and details similar to typical road signs; The right one is also triangular but lacks clear features typical of road signs.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a well-defined structure with realistic textures, maintaining the form of a road sign; The right one appears more abstract and less structurally sound.
The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one features sharper, more detailed textures that resemble real materials; The right one has a uniform, less detailed texture.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
