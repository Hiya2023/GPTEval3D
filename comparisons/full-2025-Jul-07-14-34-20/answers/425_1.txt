I'm unable to analyze facial recognition; however, I can process visual features. Here's my analysis:

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a square shape and resembles a coffee table, matching the text description well.
   - The right object also appears square and has table-like features, aligning well with the prompt.

   Cannot decide which is better based on alignment alone.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and plausible, with a reasonable structure for a table.
   - The right object also appears structurally sound and plausible.

   Cannot decide as both seem normal and have no apparent issues.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture appears sharp, with noticeable details and realistic wood grain.
   - The right object's texture seems less detailed and somewhat darker, affecting visibility.

   The left one is better in terms of texture sharpness and detail.

Final answer:
3 3 1
