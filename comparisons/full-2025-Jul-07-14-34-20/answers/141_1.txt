I'm unable to view or analyze images, but I can guide you on how to compare them using the criteria provided.

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Look for the presence of both a triangular traffic cone and a circular ball. Identify which model accurately depicts these objects and their placements according to the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Evaluate how realistic and natural each model appears. Look for correct proportions and any irregularities or unnatural features in the 3D structure.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Assess how well the textures fit onto the 3D shapes. A flower should look like a flower both in the normal map and RGB image, for example.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Examine the fine details and clarity of textures on each model. Determine which model captures these details effectively without blur.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Focus on the intricacy and organization of details in the normal maps. Identify which model demonstrates a smooth and detailed geometry structure.

6. **Overall Evaluation**: Based on steps 1 to 5, decide which model is better suited according to the criteria.

Make sure to provide a concise analysis and decision for each criterion using the options: Left is better, Right is better, or Cannot decide.

Finally, summarize your decisions for each criterion in the format: "x x x x x x".
