Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have a circular top and base, but the base is not square as per the text prompt.
   - The right object has a circular top and a more square-like base that aligns better with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object seems consistent in its shape, but its structure does not have distinguishing square features.
   - The right object appears solid, with no noticeable duplicated parts or irregularities, and its wider base provides plausibility for a stool.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object has a consistent texture, moderately detailed but not very sharp.
   - The right object shows more textural detail and realistic appearance with clearer contrast.
   - The right one is better.
