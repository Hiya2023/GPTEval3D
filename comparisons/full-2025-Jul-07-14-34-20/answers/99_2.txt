Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features a more defined conical shape for the lampshade, while the right one is more abstract and doesn't resemble a conical lampshade. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more structurally complete with recognizable base forms, whereas the right model has unusual shapes that do not seem plausible. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has textures that align more consistently with the geometry, while the right model's textures appear less integrated. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model maintains clearer texture details, while the right model seems blurrier and less defined in areas. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits more detailed and coherent geometry in the normal maps, whereas the right lacks detail and organization. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model consistently outperforms the right one across all criteria. The left one is better.

Final answer:
