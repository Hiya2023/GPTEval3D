Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object resembles a trapezoidal bookshelf more closely, featuring shelves with distinct book textures. The right object appears less defined and more unfinished in relation to the text prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more coherent shape, maintaining a recognizable shelf form. The right object looks fragmented with unclear proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows textures that align with the bookshelf's geometry, with visible textures aligned with the shape. The right one lacks clear alignment between the textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures more distinct details, with clear book textures visible on the RGB maps. The right one looks blurry and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's normal map displays more detailed and consistent bookshelf features. The right object's normals appear less precise and more irregular.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria, the left object is more aligned with the prompt and better executed.
The left one is better.
