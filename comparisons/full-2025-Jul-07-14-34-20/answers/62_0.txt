I'm unable to view or evaluate the content of images, including 3D models or multi-view images. However, I can guide you on how to perform the evaluation yourself using the criteria provided. Here's a brief explanation for each step:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Examine each 3D object to see how well they align with the description "a spherical doorknob." Check the shape, size, and any other relevant attributes to see which model more accurately reflects a spherical doorknob.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Consider how each model appears in terms of realism. Does the shape look natural and solid, like a real-world doorknob? Check for any irregularities in proportions or structures that may make the model seem implausible.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Look at how well the texture of each model adheres to its geometry. The texture should enhance the 3D form without looking out of place.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Evaluate the texture details visible in the RGB images. Look for clarity and fine details that align with the expected look of the doorknob.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Examine the normal maps for details in the geometry. Look for clean, well-defined shapes without noise.

6. **Overall Decision**: Consider the evaluations for all criteria and decide which model is better overall.

Perform each step according to these instructions, and then use the output format to document your analysis and final decision.
