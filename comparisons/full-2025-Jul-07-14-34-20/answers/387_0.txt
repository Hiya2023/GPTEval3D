Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a somewhat hexagonal shape with a reflective surface resembling a mirror, aligning relatively well with the description "A hexagonal mirror."
   - The right one appears more like a diamond or kite shape and doesn't clearly represent a hexagonal form.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more solid and plausible with no apparent strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right one, while structured, deviates from the expected hexagonal shape.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed reflections and a sharper texture, reflecting realistic mirror-like qualities.
   - The right one has a consistent texture, but it's less sharp and realistic compared to the left.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
