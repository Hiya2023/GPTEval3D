Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a basic triangular shape but lacks clear sign details. The right model clearly shows a triangular road sign with a stand.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has irregular shapes and looks less stable. The right model has more natural proportions and structure, appearing more plausible as a sign.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture does not align well with the geometry. The right model's texture aligns more closely with its shapes, maintaining the triangular sign's appearance.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has blurry textures. The right model has finer, more distinct textures that show sign details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's geometry is rough and noisy. The right model has smoother and more organized geometry, representing the sign's shape more accurately.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model consistently demonstrates better alignment with the text prompt, plausibility, and detail integrity.
The right one is better.
