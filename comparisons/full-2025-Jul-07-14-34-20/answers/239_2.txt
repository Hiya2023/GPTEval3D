Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (Object 1): The object appears to be a single, undefined shape, not clearly representing a round stool or a rectangular sofa.
   - Right (Object 2): The object is detailed but highly abstract and does not resemble a round stool or rectangular sofa.

Neither model accurately reflects the text prompt's description of a "round stool beside a rectangular sofa."

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
