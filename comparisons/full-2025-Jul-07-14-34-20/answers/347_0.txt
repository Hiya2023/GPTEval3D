Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple, single-colored round cushion.
   - The right one has a floral, colorful pattern and is also round.
   - The left one is better as it aligns more closely with the prompt “A round cushion” by emphasizing shape without additional textures or colors.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to be a solid round object without any structural issues.
   - The right one shows some irregularities and possibly duplicated parts visible around the edges.
   - The left one is better, being more normal and plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a uniform texture that is simple and lacks detail.
   - The right one has a vibrant, detailed floral texture that is sharp and realistic.
   - The right one is better due to its detailed and sharp texture.
