Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object features a clear rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests, aligning well with the text prompt. The right object is more abstract and doesn’t clearly resemble a sofa. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object looks solid and realistic, with natural proportions. The right object appears more irregular and less plausible as a real-world object.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows a good alignment between its geometry and texture, appearing cohesive. The right object has textures that do not conform well to its geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures finer details without blur, maintaining clarity. The right object’s textures are noisy and abstract.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object presents well-organized and smooth geometry details. The right object's details are chaotic and less defined.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all criteria, the left object outperforms the right in all aspects evaluated.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
