Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is rectangular, not cubic; The right one is more cubic in shape.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and plausible; The right one has a more natural cubic form.
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a good texture fit; The rightâ€™s texture aligns well with its cubic shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more detailed textures; The right one appears slightly blurry.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: Both have organized structures, but the right one better represents a cube.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one captures the cubic shape more accurately.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 3 2 1 2 2
