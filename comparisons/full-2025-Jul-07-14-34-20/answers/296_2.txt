Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1):** Shows a table with a white surface, but it appears to be round instead of hexagonal. There is an element that could be interpreted as a support or base, but there is no clear link to a mirror.
   - **Right (object 2):** Shows an object resembling a cylindrical form, but lacks features that depict a table or mirror.

Evaluation:
- The left one partially reflects the table aspect but misses the hexagonal shape and the mirror component.
- The right one fails to depict the table and mirror as described.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
