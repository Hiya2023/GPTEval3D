Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more rectangular form and doesn't fully represent a cubic ottoman; The right one has a more cube-like shape and captures the ottoman design better. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more rectangular and less like a solid ottoman shape; The right one has a stronger cube-like and plausible form.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture doesn't align well with its shape, appearing inconsistent; The right one's texture aligns well with the cubic shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one's textures are blurry and inconsistent; The right one has rich, detailed textures with a cohesive pattern.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks clear geometric details; The right one shows a well-defined structure.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better captures the prompt with a more plausible, aligned, and detailed design.
The right one is better.
