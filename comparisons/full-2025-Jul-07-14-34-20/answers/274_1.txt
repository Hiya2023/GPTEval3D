I'm unable to see or describe the contents of the images you've provided. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the text prompt:

1. Identify if the object matches the description of a "triangular shelf with round edges."
2. Evaluate the shape: Ensure it is triangular with rounded edges.
3. Compare how each model represents these features:
   - Object 1: Check if it aligns with being a shelf, and has the correct shape.
   - Object 2: Do the same evaluation for its shape and roundness.

Follow a structure like this for your analysis:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) [describe how it aligns or does not align with the prompt].
   - The right one (object 2) [describe how it aligns or does not align with the prompt].
   
Make a decision about which is better or if a decision cannot be reached.

Once you have done the evaluation, summarize your findings.

Final answer:
Choose from the three options:
1. Left (object 1) is better.
2. Right (object 2) is better.
3. Cannot decide.

Apply this analysis method to determine which object best fits the prompt description.
