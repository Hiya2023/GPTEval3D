Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one depicts a triangular sign which aligns with the text prompt. The right one shows a rectangular road sign, which does not match the description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more coherent shape and looks like a plausible 3D model of a triangular road sign. The right one appears more like a flat panel.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s textures match the triangular shape. The right one’s textures align with its shape but do not match the prompt.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures more distinctive details on the sign. The right one appears more uniform and lacks intricate texture variations.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits more defined geometric details, such as the 3D edges of the triangle. The right one is simpler in structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one accurately captures the prompt and exhibits better detail and plausibility.
The left one is better.
