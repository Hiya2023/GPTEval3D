Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more detailed and decorative fabric pattern, and while it appears cubic, itâ€™s somewhat rounded at the corners.
   - The right one is more cubic but lacks detail.
   - The left one is more vibrant and aligns with being an ottoman, while the right one is more geometrically accurate to "cubic."
   - Cannot decide which one is better since both have strengths in different areas of the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more visually solid and object-like with no obvious structural issues, despite its decorative style.
   - The right one, despite being cubic, seems less solid and less plausible due to overly smooth and uniform texture.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has detailed, sharp, and realistic fabric textures.
   - The right one has very smooth, low-detail texture.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
