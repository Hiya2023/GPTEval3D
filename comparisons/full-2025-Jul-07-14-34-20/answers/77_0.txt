I'm unable to view or compare images directly. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on your criteria:

1. **Text prompt and Asset Alignment**: Evaluate if each model includes a triangular traffic cone and a circular ball. See which model captures these elements as described.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Check both models for realistic proportions and natural positioning. Look for anomalies like duplicated parts or structural inconsistencies.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: For each model, ensure the texture matches the underlying geometry. Check if the textures on the traffic cone and ball are accurately represented in both RGB and normal images.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Examine the closeness and clarity of the texture details on the models. Identify which model reflects fine textures more effectively without blurriness.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Focus on the geometry details within the normal maps. Determine which model possesses a more organized and intricate geometry.

6. **Overall Evaluation**: After assessing the above factors individually, decide which model better meets the text prompt and displays better overall quality.

Use the provided steps to conduct a detailed analysis, and then fill out your summary based on your observations.
