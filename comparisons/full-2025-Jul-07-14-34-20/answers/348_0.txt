Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a more complex structure with layers and vibrant colors but doesn't resemble a "hexagonal table under a round mirror."
   - The right object looks like a simple cylindrical form, which is closer to a basic table but doesn't include the hexagonal shape or a mirror either.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object has a more complex design and seems solid, but it's not the shape of a table.
   - The right object is simpler and has a straightforward cylindrical shape, appearing more plausible as a solid object.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has sharper and more detailed textures, with distinct colors and patterns.
   - The right object has a smoother, less detailed texture.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
