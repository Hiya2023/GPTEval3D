I'm unable to directly compare or interpret the images, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the given criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - *Left (Object 1)*: Describe the alignment of this object with being "a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal." Does it have spherical and cubic elements?
   - *Right (Object 2)*: Describe the alignment of this object with the prompt. Are the spherical and cubic elements present?

   Evaluate which one aligns better with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - *Left (Object 1)*: Consider the solidity and normalcy of the 3D model. Are there strange body problems or duplicated parts?
   - *Right (Object 2)*: Look for noisy or meaningless 3D structures. Is it solid and plausible?

   Decide which model is more plausible.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - *Left (Object 1)*: Examine the sharpness, realism, and detail of the texture in local parts.
   - *Right (Object 2)*: Focus similarly on texture details.

   Determine which has better texture quality.

### Final answer:
- Combine your evaluations for each category, categorizing them as "Left is better," "Right is better," or "Cannot decide" using sparse usage of the third option.

The decision output should look like numbers corresponding to these decisions, e.g., "1 2 2" or "3 3 3."
