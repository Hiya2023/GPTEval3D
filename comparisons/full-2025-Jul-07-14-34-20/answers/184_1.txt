Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one closely resembles a square coffee table with clean lines; the right one has irregular geometry.  
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid with proper proportions and structure; the right one has distorted shapes.  
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its geometry, while the right one shows poor alignment and more noise.  
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one maintains clarity and detail without being overly abstract; the right one is noisy and lacks detail.  
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has well-organized structures and smooth surfaces, while the right one exhibits chaotic, noisy patterns.  
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all factors, the left model better fulfills the criteria.  
The left one is better.
