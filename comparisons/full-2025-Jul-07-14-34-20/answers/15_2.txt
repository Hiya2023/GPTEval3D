I'm unable to display or compare images directly. However, I can provide guidance on how to evaluate the 3D objects using the criteria mentioned:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Evaluate each object to see if it includes a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal. Analyze the shape and structure in relation to these elements.
   - Decide which object better represents a "spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Consider the overall shape and structure of each model. Look for natural and solid appearance, proper proportions, and absence of noise or distortion.
   - Determine which model appears more realistic and physically plausible.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - Check if the textures on the models align with their corresponding shapes, such as rounded textures on spheres.
   - Decide which model has better consistency between texture and geometry.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Focus on the clarity and detail of textures in the RGB images. Consider whether any texture appears blurry or lacks detail.
   - Choose the model that captures fine texture details effectively.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - Examine the normal maps for intricate geometry details. Assess which model shows well-organized structures and efficient detail representation.
   - Decide which model has superior geometry detail.

6. **Overall**:
   - Summarize the evaluations above to decide which object is better overall according to all criteria.

You may use this framework to analyze the images and provide a conclusion for each criterion as requested.
