I'm unable to identify or analyze the objects based on your comparison request. The images appear to depict objects resembling vases rather than spherical chairs. To evaluate them properly as 3D models of spherical chairs with flat seats, clarity in their depiction related to the text prompt is needed.

If you have more appropriate examples or context, feel free to share!
