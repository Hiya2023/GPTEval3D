Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left: Shows a sofa with cylindrical armrests clearly visible. 
   - Right: Less clear structure; cylindrical armrests aren't distinguishable.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - Left: Appears more structured and defined as a sofa.
   - Right: Blurry and lacks solid form.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - Left: The texture aligns well with the sofaâ€™s structure.
   - Right: Texture does not clearly define a sofa shape.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - Left: Textures are clearer and more detailed.
   - Right: Textures are blurry and lack definition.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - Left: Shows more organized structure and detail.
   - Right: Geometry is less defined and contains noise.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model captures all aspects better, from structure to texture details.
   The left one is better.
