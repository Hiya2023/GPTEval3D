Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   The left one has a conical shape but a complex base, not cylindrical; 
   The right one is cylindrical and looks simpler, matching the prompt better.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   The left one has irregular structures; 
   The right one has a straightforward columnar shape, more plausible for a lamp base.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   The left one shows mismatched textures on complex geometry; 
   The right one's textures align well with its cylindrical form.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   The left one has detailed textures but seems overly complex; 
   The right one has simpler, clear textures.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   The left one has intricate but noisy geometry; 
   The right one has smooth, well-ordered details.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   The right one corresponds more with the prompt and is more coherent.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
