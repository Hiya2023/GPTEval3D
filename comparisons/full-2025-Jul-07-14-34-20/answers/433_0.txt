I'm unable to make detailed evaluations of 3D objects based on images, but I can help guide you on how to perform the analysis. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**:
    - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe the object considering the prompt "A triangular shelf with round edges." Does it appear triangular and have rounded edges?
    - **Right (Object 2)**: Describe the object similarly. How well does it align with being a "triangular shelf with round edges"?
    - Evaluate which model aligns better with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
    - **Left (Object 1)**: Examine for any irregularities. Does it appear as a solid, plausible 3D object without strange or duplicated parts?
    - **Right (Object 2)**: Check similarly for 3D consistency.
    - Decide which model appears more normal and plausible.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
    - **Left (Object 1)**: Assess the texture's sharpness, realism, and detail.
    - **Right (Object 2)**: Evaluate the texture in the same way.
    - Determine which one has better texture quality.

### Final Decision:
1. State your choice for Text Prompt & 3D Alignment.
2. State your choice for 3D Plausibility.
3. State your choice for Low-Level Texture.

This approach should help you compare the two objects based on the given criteria. If you need further assistance based on observations, let me know!
