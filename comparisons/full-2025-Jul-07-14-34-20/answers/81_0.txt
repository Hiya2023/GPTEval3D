Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is an octagonal lampshade on a decorative base; The right one has an abstract shape not resembling a conical shade. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows a more coherent object; The right one has irregular shapes and parts. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s textures fit the shape better; The right one’s textures do not match well with the geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays clearer texture details; The right one appears more abstract and less defined. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one presents smoother and more organized geometry; The right one shows disorganized details. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria above, the left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
