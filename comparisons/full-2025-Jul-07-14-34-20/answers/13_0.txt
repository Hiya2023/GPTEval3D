Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has an abstract, colorful appearance and doesn't clearly reflect a rectangular bookshelf. The right one clearly represents a bookshelf with rectangular shapes evident. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less solid and more abstract. The right one seems more natural with a plausible bookshelf structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures do not align clearly with a bookshelf structure. The right one's textures are consistent with the rectangular shelves.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one's textures are abstract and blurry. The right one has clearer texture details that match the object.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks detailed geometry and seems noisy. The right one has more defined geometric details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one effectively represents a "rectangular bookshelf" with better plausibility and detail.
The right one is better.
