Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object has a spherical shape with a base similar to a doorknob's mounting. It aligns well with the prompt "A spherical doorknob."
   - The right object is also spherical with a more distinct base, resembling a doorknob as well.
   - Both align well with the text prompt, but the left one has a slightly more defined structure typical for a doorknob.
   - **The left one is better.**

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid and plausible, with normal, coherent shapes and no strange features.
   - The right object also appears plausible, but its base seems less distinct.
   - Both are plausible, but the left has more traditional design features.
   - **The left one is better.**

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture is smooth but slightly less detailed and sharp than ideal.
   - The right object has a more consistent texture and seems sharper in some aspects.
   - **The right one is better.**
