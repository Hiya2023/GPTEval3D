Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left model appears more cubic and aligns better with the description of "a cubic ottoman."
   - The right model seems less cubic and more rounded.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more solid and has believable proportions for an ottoman.
   - The right model seems slightly irregular in shape.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture seems to fit the cubic shape better.
   - The right model's texture does not align as well with the intended shape.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model offers finer texture details without blurriness.
   - The right model's texture appears less defined.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model shows a more coherent structure with smoother surfaces.
   - The right model appears more uneven and noisy.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model is more cubic, plausible, and detailed.
   - The left one is better.
