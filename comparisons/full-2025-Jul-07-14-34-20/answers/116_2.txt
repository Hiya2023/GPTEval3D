Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   The left one looks irregular and doesn't resemble a cushion. The right one has a clear cushion-like shape and pattern. 
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   The left one appears unnatural with irregular shapes. The right one has a plausible cushion form with appropriate proportions.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   The left one displays inconsistencies between texture and shape. The right one shows good alignment with patterns matching the structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   The left one lacks detail and appears blurry. The right one has intricate and clear texture patterns.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   The left one has meaningless noise and poor structure. The right one has neat and detailed geometry matching a cushion.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: 
   The right one consistently aligns with all criteria, resembling a real cushion closely.
   The right one is better.
