Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a more cylindrical shape with a clearer flared top, while the right is more abstract and less aligned with the prompt;
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more solid and resembles a plausible vase, while the right object looks irregular and less stable;
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object’s texture aligns more consistently with its geometry, while the right object’s texture is less coherent with its structure;
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object shows more precise details and less blurriness, while the right is more indistinct and noisy;
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object’s geometry is more organized and smooth, while the right one appears noisy and less defined;
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object more closely matches the prompt and exhibits better structure and detailing;
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
