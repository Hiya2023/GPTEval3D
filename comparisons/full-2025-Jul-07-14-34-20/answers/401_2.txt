I'm unable to provide a direct comparison of images, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the criteria you mentioned:

Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The model appears to be a globe on a stand. It does not correspond well to the prompt "A cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk."
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The model seems to be a basic spherical object on a stand. It also does not align with the prompt.
   - **Decision**: Cannot decide, as neither aligns with the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The globe on a stand looks normal and plausible as a 3D model.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The spherical object is less detailed and lacks definition compared to the left.
   - **Decision**: Left (Object 1) is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The texture on the globe appears detailed, with recognizable continents and a stand showing more texture.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Lacks detail and sharpness in texture.
   - **Decision**: Left (Object 1) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
