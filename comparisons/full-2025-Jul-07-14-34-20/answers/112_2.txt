Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a cube with a more pronounced base, aligning better with the curved base description.
   - The right object also shows a cubic structure but the base appears less defined.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has noticeably solid proportions.
   - The right object appears less structurally plausible.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture aligns well with its geometric contours.
   - The right object's texture seems slightly misaligned with geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object maintains sharp, clear textures.
   - The right object's textures appear a bit blurred.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows clear, detailed contours in its normal map.
   - The right object's normal map is less detailed.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the left object is more accurate and coherent.
   The left one is better.
