I'm unable to provide specific details on the images, but I can guide you through how to conduct the analysis based on the criteria you provided.

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**:

   - **Left (Object 1)**: Based on the description, evaluate whether the object looks like a "triangular shelf with round edges". Does it have any triangular shape or round edges?
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Similarly, assess if this object matches the prompt description. 

   If neither resembles the description, clarify that.

   - **Decision**: Decide which one aligns better with the text prompt or if you cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility**:

   - **Left (Object 1)**: Examine if the 3D model seems realistic and plausible, without strange shapes or duplicated parts.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Consider the solidity and normal look of the model.

   - **Decision**: Consider which model appears more plausible.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:

   - **Left (Object 1)**: Look at the sharpness, detail, and realism of the textures.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Do the same assessment for this object.

   - **Decision**: Choose which one has more realistic and detailed textures.

### Final Answer:

Since I can't view or interpret the exact details of the images:
- **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: [Evaluate your observations]
  
- **3D Plausibility**: [Evaluate your observations]
  
- **Low-Level Texture**: [Evaluate your observations]

Provide your final decision with one of the three options (e.g., 1 2 2).

You can use the above structure to fill in your evaluations and conclusions based on your observations of the images.
