Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have cylindrical forms that could represent armrests but lacks a clear rectangular shape typical of a sofa.
   - The right one resembles a more rectangular sofa with some form of armrests, matching the prompt better.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has an irregular shape with too many protrusions and lacks solidity.
   - The right one appears more solid and resembles a plausible 3D object.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has uneven, less defined textures.
   - The right one seems to have more consistent, albeit slightly blurred, texture.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
