I'm unable to see the images as described, but based on the text prompt, here's how you can proceed:

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one should be evaluated for how well it represents a "spherical chair with a flat seat."
   - The right one should similarly be assessed.
   - Determine which one more accurately captures the description.
   - The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - Consider the naturalness and solidity of the models. Check for any irregularities or implausible features.
   - Evaluate if the proportions are correct and if the model resembles real-world objects.
   - The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - Examine how well textures adhere to the geometry of each model, ensuring they match both in RGB and normal maps.
   - Look for any misalignments or inconsistencies in the texture application.
   - The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - Focus on the clarity and details of the texture, ensuring they are not blurry and align with the expected aesthetic.
   - The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - Review the normal maps for accurate representation of shapes and absence of noise.
   - Determine which model has a more refined and smooth structure.
   - The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

6. Overall: 
   - Considering all the criteria above, decide which model is generally better.
   - The left/right one is better or cannot decide.
