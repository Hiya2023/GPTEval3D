Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a clear conical lampshade on a cylindrical base, aligning well with the prompt. The right model appears to have a more complex structure not accurately reflecting the description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks natural and solid, with appropriate lamp proportions. The right model has irregular and fragmented structures, lacking plausibility.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its simple geometry, representing a lampshade realistically. The right model's textures do not significantly match its disjointed geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details that are consistent and clear. The right model's textures are complex and mismatched, making it less effective.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a clean, well-organized structure. The right model has fragmented geometry that lacks coherence and detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model consistently aligns with the given criteria, reflecting the text prompt accurately, with better plausibility, alignment of texture, and detail.
The left one is better.
