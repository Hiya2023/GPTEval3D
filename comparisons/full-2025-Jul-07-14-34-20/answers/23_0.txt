I'm unable to directly compare 3D objects through images, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the criteria provided. 

Consider the following:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Evaluate how well each model depicts a "cubic lamp with a curved base." This involves checking if the cube shape and curved base are apparent in both models.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Determine which model seems more realistic or solid as an object. Look for any oddities in proportions and structure in both RGB and normal maps.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Check if the textures align well with the shapes depicted in the normal maps. Look for consistency in shapes and textures.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Focus on the sharpness and detail in textures. Determine which model has clearer texture details without blurriness.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Examine the intricacies in the normal maps. Look for well-defined and organized geometry that represents the intended shapes.

6. **Overall**: Based on the above analyses, determine which model is superior overall.

To complete the task, analyze these specific aspects for each object and decide on each criterion accordingly.
