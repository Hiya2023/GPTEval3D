```
Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   The left object incorporates complex surroundings, while the right one clearly represents a hexagonal mirror as described.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   The left object appears inconsistent and fragmented, whereas the right one is stable and coherent.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   The left object has mismatched geometry and texture, while the right object shows clear alignment.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   The left object exhibits distracting details, whereas the right one's details are clearer and relevant.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   The left object shows noise and disarray in geometry, while the right object maintains neat and defined edges.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, 
   The right object better meets all evaluation criteria.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
