Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to depict a low, rectangular structure with undefined features. It does not clearly represent a "spherical lamp on a square nightstand."
   - The right one, while also not perfectly aligned with the prompt, shows a structured, possibly lamp-like portion on top of what could be interpreted as a nightstand, though it includes additional ornate elements not specified in the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems to be less structured, with irregularities and lacking coherence in form.
   - The right one shows a more coherent structure, with a clear base and top, though the ornate design may not be realistic.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one lacks detailed texture and appears fuzzy.
   - The right one displays more detailed and defined textures, showing variations in color and pattern.
   - The right one is better.
