I'm unable to view or analyze the images directly. However, I can offer guidance on how you might perform the evaluation based on the criteria you've provided. Here's how you can undertake the analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Compare the spherical shapes and the doorknob features mentioned in the text prompt. Check both models for accuracy in capturing these attributes.

   - Evaluate how well each model matches the description of a "spherical doorknob."

2. **3D Plausibility**: Look at the natural appearance and solid form of the models. Consider body proportions and structural anomalies.

   - Examine any visible irregularities or unrealistic features in both models.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Check the coherence between texture and geometry. Ensure that the textures and shapes are in harmony and represent the spherical form accurately in both RGB and normal images.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Focus on the fine details of texture and clarity. Identify any blurriness or undesirable abstractions.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Analyze the precision of geometric details. Look for well-organized structures and meaningful high-frequency details.

6. **Overall Evaluation**: Consider the combined results of the above criteria to determine which model succeeds better across all factors.

In analyzing these aspects independently, discern which model, if any, more closely aligns with the ideal representation of a "spherical doorknob" as described.
