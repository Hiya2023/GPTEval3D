Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left image shows a nightstand with a spherical lamp which matches the prompt. The right image shows a couch, which doesn't align with the prompt. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left image has a solid, plausible shape for a nightstand and lamp, while the right one is a couch, which is incorrect for the prompt.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one shows a consistent alignment between the texture and geometry of the lamp and nightstand. The right one doesn't match the text prompt.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left image captures fine details appropriate for its objects, the right image is detailed but irrelevant to the prompt.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left image's details are appropriate and well-formed for the lamp and nightstand; the right one is irrelevant.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment with the prompt and plausibility, the left one is better.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
