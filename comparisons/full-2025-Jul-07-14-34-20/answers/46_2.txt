Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model appears more irregular and doesn't strongly resemble a cubic shape. The right model has a clearer cubic form with a curved base. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model is irregular with less defined shapes. The right model looks more like a plausible object with a defined cubic form.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model exhibits poor alignment between texture and geometry. The right model shows better cohesion between its RGB and normal images.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has less defined textures. The right model has sharper and clearer textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model lacks clear geometric detail. The right model shows more structured and finer geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model is more coherent with the prompt and displays better quality in structure and detail.
The right one is better.
