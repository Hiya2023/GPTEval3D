Based on your evaluation criteria, here's the analysis:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a more pronounced trapezoidal shape, whereas the right model looks more rectangular. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural with regular proportions, while the right model has slightly irregular, inconsistent shapes. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: In the left model, the texture aligns well with the geometry, matching the structure seen in RGB and normal images. The right model's geometry often seems mismatched with the texture. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model displays clearer and more detailed textures without blurring compared to the right model's textures. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows well-organized structures and intricate details, while the right one appears noisier. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model excels in reflecting the text prompt and maintains high quality across all aspects evaluated. The left one is better.
