I'm unable to directly evaluate the attributes and alignment of 3D objects based on text prompts with images. However, I can help facilitate analysis by guiding you through what to consider when evaluating.

For your task, you'd want to:
- Assess whether each model has a triangular shape resembling a shelf.
- Check for round edges as described in the prompt.
- Evaluate how closely the structure and design details match a shelf.

To determine which model better aligns with the text prompt's description, carefully compare each object to ensure it meets these criteria. After thorough analysis, decide if one fits the description better than the other.
