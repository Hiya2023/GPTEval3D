Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a circular or spherical shape with a yellow hue, having no clear triangular features.
   - The right model is also rounded without triangular attributes.
   - Neither aligns with "A triangular shelf with round edges."
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more solid, with a distinct and discernible shape, though not as a shelf.
   - The right model appears less defined and structured.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has sharper and more defined textures.
   - The right model appears smooth and less detailed.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
