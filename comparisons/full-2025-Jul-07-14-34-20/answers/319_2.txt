Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple, round, cushion-like object meeting the "round cushion" prompt well.
   - The right one, though round, has additional patterns and colors not specified in the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears solid and plausible as a cushion.
   - The right one also seems solid but its complexity might indicate non-cushion elements.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one's texture appears soft but might lack detail.
   - The right one has more detailed and intricate patterns and textures.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
