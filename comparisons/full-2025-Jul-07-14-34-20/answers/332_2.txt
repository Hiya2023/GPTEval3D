Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a diamond shape that could be interpreted as a hexagonal mirror with a triangular frame, though the triangular aspect isn't very clear.
   - The right one also resembles a diamond, but it lacks a clear triangular frame.
   - The left one is better in terms of matching the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more structurally sound and defined in both the RGB and normal images.
   - The right one appears less structured and more amorphous.
   - The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more distinct and sharper textures, with visible details on the frame.
   - The right one has a smoother, less detailed texture.
   - The left one is better in terms of low-level texture.

Final answer:
