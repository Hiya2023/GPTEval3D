Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one looks like a vase with floral patterns, not matching the prompt of a "rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - The right one appears to be a lamp, also not aligning with the prompt.
   The left and right both do not align with the text prompt, but the right one slightly resembles furniture more than the left.

   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and well-formed as a vase-like object.
   - The right one also appears solid and plausible as a lamp, showing typical lamp features.
   The right one has a more conventional and recognizable shape.

   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed floral textures and vibrant colors.
   - The right one has a simpler, less detailed texture with a more uniform surface.
   The left one has sharper and more detailed textures.

   The left one is better.
