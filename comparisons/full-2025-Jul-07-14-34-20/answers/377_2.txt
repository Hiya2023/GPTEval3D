Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a rectangular shape and features cylindrical armrests, aligning well with the prompt.
   - The right object also aligns with the prompt but includes additional elements like cushions, which are not mentioned in the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid and plausible, with consistent shapes and no evident issues.
   - The right object has extraneous details and a somewhat complex structure that might affect its solidity.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has smoother textures but lacks detail.
   - The right object displays more intricate textures and details, making it appear more realistic at a micro level.
   - The right one is better.
