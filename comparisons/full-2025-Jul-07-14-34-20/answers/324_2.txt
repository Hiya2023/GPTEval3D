I'm unable to view the images you provided, but I can still guide you through the comparison process if you can describe the models based on the images you see. Here's how you should approach the analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - Describe the appearance of each model.
   - Evaluate how well each model corresponds to the prompt: "A round stool beside a rectangular sofa."
   - Decide which one aligns better with the description: Left is better, right is better, or cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Consider both the RGB and normal images to imagine the 3D structure.
   - Check each model for normalcy, solidity, and the presence of any unusual or noisy elements.
   - Determine which model is more plausible: Left is better, right is better, or cannot decide.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - Focus on local details in the RGB images.
   - Compare sharpness, realism, and detail.
   - Decide which has superior texture: Left is better, right is better, or cannot decide.

### Final Decision:
Express your findings for each criterion as: "1 2 2" or "3 3 3" or similar based on the comparisons.

Provide the final results based on your analysis.
