Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - Left: The left object is green and has a very rough texture, not resembling a typical cushion.
   - Right: The right object is colorful with floral patterns, more aligned with the concept of a decorative cushion.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: The left object appears misshapen and lacks realistic solidity, possibly appearing more like a rough organic mass than a cushion.
   - Right: The right object has a more defined shape and proportions consistent with a cushion, although there are some artifacts in the structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - Left: The texture is very simple, lacking detail and realism.
   - Right: The right object has detailed floral textures, making it more visually appealing and realistic as a fabric cushion.
   - The right one is better.
