Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears as a square sign with additional unclear textures, which doesn't match the triangular aspect.
   - The right one resembles a triangular road sign.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks less conventional due to its shape and textures.
   - The right one has more realistic proportions for a road sign.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's geometry doesn't align well with the concept of a road sign.
   - The right one's textures and geometry are more cohesive.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has noisy and unclear details.
   - The right one appears clearer and more precise.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has less distinct geometry representation.
   - The right one exhibits smooth and clear geometrical aspects.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right model fits the prompt and requirements better.
   The right one is better.
