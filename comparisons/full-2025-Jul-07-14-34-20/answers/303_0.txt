I'm unable to directly see the images you've provided, but I can still guide you on how to evaluate them based on your criteria:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - The left one should be assessed for how well it represents a "rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror." Look for any hints of rectangular forms or mirror-like features.
   - The right one should similarly be assessed for these characteristics.
   - If one of the objects clearly shows a rectangular shape with something resembling a mirror, it will better align with the text prompt.
   
2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Evaluate each model for normal, solid, and plausible structures. Look for any strange body issues, duplicated parts, or odd formations.
   - The one that appears more cohesive and physically plausible would be better in this metric.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - Assess the sharpness, realism, and level of detail in the textures of both models.
   - Pay attention to how well-defined the textures appear in close-up views.

**Final Decision:**
- Based on your evaluation in each category, assign one of the options 1 (left is better), 2 (right is better), or 3 (cannot decide) for each aspect, and summarize it in your answer.
