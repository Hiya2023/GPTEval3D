Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has an irregular shape with unclear rectangular features; the right one clearly has distinct rectangular sections. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less stable and proportionate; the right one has a more solid and natural bookshelf appearance.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture does not align well with its geometry, appearing distorted; the right one displays a more consistent alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one's textures seem noisy and blurry; the right one has clearer, more defined textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has irregular and disorganized geometric features; the right one displays smoother and more structured geometric details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one aligns better with the text prompt and provides a more plausible, well-defined model.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
