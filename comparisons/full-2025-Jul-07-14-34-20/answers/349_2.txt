Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a simple, square shape that aligns with a basic coffee table design, though details are hard to discern.
   - The right one clearly shows a square table with more emphasis on details and structure.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to be simpler and more consistent but lacks detail, making it somewhat flat.
   - The right one seems more detailed, showing more structure and detail, but the uneven texture might affect its plausibility slightly.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a very smooth texture which makes it hard to see details.
   - The right one has a detailed, rich texture, making it stand out with more realism and complexity.
   - The right one is better.
