I'm unable to provide an assessment of 3D models based on images. However, I can guide you on how to analyze them:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: Check if the objects resemble a "spherical chair with a flat seat." Look for spherical contours and a flat seating area. Assess how each model fulfills these criteria.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Evaluate the solidity and coherence of each object. Look for any irregularities, duplications, or meaningless parts. Assess which appears more structurally sound.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: Examine the details of each object's surface. Look for clarity, realism, and fine details that add to a believable texture.

To perform this comparison, carefully analyze the given aspects using the instructions Iâ€™ve provided.
