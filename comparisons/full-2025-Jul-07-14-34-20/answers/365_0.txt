Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to show a green, spherical object resting on a textured base, which may not align well with a "triangular traffic cone" or a "circular ball."
   - The right one shows a structure with a spherical shape on a stand, which includes a spherical element but lacks a triangular cone.
   - Cannot decide, as neither fully aligns with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a cohesive spherical structure, but it's unclear if it convincingly depicts a cone or a conventional ball.
   - The right one looks like a plausible lamp or similar object with a spherical element on a stand, being more structurally coherent.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows a consistent texture but lacks realism in depicting a traffic cone or ball.
   - The right one has sharper and more detailed textures, particularly on the stand and sphere.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
