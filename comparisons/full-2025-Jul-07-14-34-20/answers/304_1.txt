Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model (object 1) has a distinctive elliptical table shape and pronounced circular legs that align well with the "elliptical coffee table with circular legs" prompt.
   - The right model (object 2) also appears elliptical with circular legs but lacks distinctiveness in the table shape.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model (object 1) appears solid and well-formed in both the RGB and normal renderings, showing clear structural integrity with no obvious duplication or noise.
   - The right model (object 2) seems less defined and slightly uneven in structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model (object 1) displays sharper textures with more detailed features on both the surface and legs.
   - The right model (object 2) has a more subdued texture lacking in detail.
   - The left one is better.
