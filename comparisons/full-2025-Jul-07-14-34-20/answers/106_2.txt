```
Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one mostly aligns with the prompt, with a cubic shape and appearance; the right one is less cubic. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a simple, realistic structure; the right one appears distorted. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has consistent texture with geometry; the right one appears misaligned. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clear textures appropriate to an ottoman; the right one looks noisy. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother and consistent geometry; the right one has irregularities. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one exhibits more accurate asset alignment, plausibility, and detail quality.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
