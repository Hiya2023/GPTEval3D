I'm unable to provide a description of the images directly. However, here's an analysis based on your instructions:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (Object 1): Does not resemble a triangular shelf with round edges. Appears more spherical in shape with legs.
   - The right one (Object 2): Similarly does not fit the description of a triangular shelf. It also has a spherical form.

Both objects are chairs and do not align with the text prompt of a "triangular shelf with round edges."

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide). Neither object seems to match the description given.
