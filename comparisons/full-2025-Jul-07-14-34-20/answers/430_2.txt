Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a hexagonal lampshade but lacks a distinct conical shape; the base appears more organic than cylindrical.
   - The right object also has a hexagonal lampshade without a clear conical form; it lacks a visible base entirely.
   - The left one is better as it has a more defined base.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears to have a more structured and solid form, although the base seems more decorative than functional.
   - The right object lacks a base and appears more abstract and less plausible as a complete lampshade.
   - The left one is better as it appears more normal and solid.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has noticeable textures on the lampshade and base, though they are somewhat blurred.
   - The right object has even less detail and clarity in its textures.
   - The left one is better as its textures are sharper with more details.
