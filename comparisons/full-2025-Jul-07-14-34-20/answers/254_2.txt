Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one: Features some cubic structure, but lacks a spherical globe. The design is abstract and doesn't clearly represent the described objects.
   - The right one: Appears to have a structure on legs but does not represent a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal. No clear spherical or cubic elements.

Neither model closely aligns with the prompt, but the left one at least hints at a cubic form. However, neither achieves the goal effectively.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
