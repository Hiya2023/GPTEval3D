Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object (Object 1) is a lamp with a tapered shade and a cylindrical base, not matching the description of a "rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror." The right object (Object 2) also resembles a lamp with a spiral pattern on the shade and base, which does not align with the text prompt either. Neither object accurately reflects the prompt.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
