I'm unable to analyze or compare the image directly, but hereâ€™s a structured approach to how you might evaluate the images:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe the shape and any features of the bookshelf, noting how trapezoidal it appears.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Describe the features and check if they align with the trapezoidal description.
   - Decision: Choose the one that better represents a trapezoidal bookshelf.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Consider if the model looks solid, with no strange or duplicated parts.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Evaluate the solidity and normality of this model.
   - Decision: Choose the one that appears more normal and solid.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Look at the sharpness, realism, and detail of the textures.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Compare the texture detail and realism.
   - Decision: Choose the one with sharper, more detailed textures.

### Final Answer:

This is where you would input your decisions in the format:

"x x x" (e.g., 1 2 2 / 3 3 3 / 3 2 2) 

Make your judgments based on observations from the multi-view images provided.
