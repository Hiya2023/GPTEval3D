Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one does not clearly show a circular clock or a cuboid bookshelf.
   - The right one also lacks a clear circular clock and does not resemble a cuboid bookshelf.
   
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to be more solid and structured but lacks clear definition.
   - The right one has noisy and duplicated structures that seem less plausible.

   Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more uniform texture with subtle details.
   - The right one has sharper textures with more contrast and detail.

   Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 2
