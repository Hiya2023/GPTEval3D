I'm unable to fully identify the objects based on your description. However, I can analyze the visible attributes based on your inputs.

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **Left**: Appears as a decorated vase with floral patterns.
   - **Right**: Looks like a table lamp.
   - Neither aligns well with the prompt "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - **Cannot decide**.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left**: Appears solid with coherent structure; no noticeable issues.
   - **Right**: Also appears solid and well-formed.
   - Both are plausible, but structure seems clearer in the right.
   - **Right is better**.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left**: Textures are colorful and intricate with noticeable detail in floral pattern.
   - **Right**: Textures appear realistic with gradient and shadow details.
   - Textures are more intricate on the left.
   - **Left is better**.
