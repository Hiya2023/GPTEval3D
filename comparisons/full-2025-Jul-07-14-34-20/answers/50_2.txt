Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a rectangular sign, while the right object is a triangular sign. The prompt specifies a triangular road sign. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object looks like a plausible road sign, but rectangular, while the right one appears more triangular, with realistic textures.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left sign shows consistent alignment between the texture and geometry, but doesn't fit the prompt. The right object has a better alignment with triangular shape and texture.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clear details but is not correct in shape. The right one has better texture fidelity in line with the correct geometric shape.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows organized geometry but presents as a rectangle. The right one displays more intricate and relevant triangular geometry with plausible details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects and the text prompt, the right object better fulfills the criteria.
The right one is better.


Final answer:
