Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a hexagonal shape, aligning well with the prompt "A hexagonal mirror."
   - The right object is more of a diamond shape, which does not align with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a solid and coherent hexagonal object.
   - The right one has an inconsistent shape that seems less plausible as a mirror.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a blurred texture with less detail.
   - The right object has more defined textures and details.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
