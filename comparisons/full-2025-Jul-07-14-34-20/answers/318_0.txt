I'm unable to view or compare specific images, but I can guide you on how to make the comparisons. Hereâ€™s how you can analyze the images based on the criteria provided:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Check if the object has a clear spherical globe and a distinct cubic pedestal. Does it match the prompt "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal"?
   - **Right (Object 2):** Assess similarly if it has the characteristic elements described in the prompt.
   - **Decision:** Determine which model aligns more closely with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Consider if the geometry looks solid and plausible. Are there any strange body problems or noisy structures?
   - **Right (Object 2):** Evaluate the solidity and realism of the 3D structure.
   - **Decision:** Decide which object has a more plausible and coherent 3D form.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Check the quality of the textures. Are they sharp and realistic?
   - **Right (Object 2):** Inspect for detailed and realistic texturing.
   - **Decision:** Choose the object with more detailed and higher-quality textures.

**Final Answer:**
- Based on your observations, summarize your decisions for each criterion using the options: 1 (Left is better), 2 (Right is better), or 3 (Cannot decide). For example, "1 2 1" indicates left is better for alignment, right for plausibility, and left for texture.
