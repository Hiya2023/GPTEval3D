I'm unable to view or evaluate the content of the images directly. Therefore, I cannot specifically compare the models based on the criteria mentioned. However, I can provide you with a structured approach to evaluate the images yourself:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - Focus on how well each model represents a "rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - Check if both the sofa and mirror are accurately depicted in terms of shape and position.
   - Identify which model captures the prompt's elements more distinctly.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Examine each model for natural proportions and realistic detailing.
   - Look for any irregularities or unrealistic features.
   - Determine which model presents a more convincing 3D object.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Evaluate how well the textures are mapped onto the 3D geometry.
   - Check if the textures and shapes align accurately in both the RGB and normal images.
   - Decide which model shows a better integration of texture and form.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Assess the level of detail in the textures themselves.
   - Consider clarity, realism, and aesthetic alignment with the prompt.
   - Determine which model has more detailed and coherent textures.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Focus on the intricacy and clarity of the shapes in the normal maps.
   - Evaluate the organization and smoothness of the geometry.
   - Decide which model captures the intended shapes more effectively.

6. **Overall:**
   - Based on the analyses of each criterion, conclude which model better fulfills the task requirements.
   - Make your decision based on which one is more aligned with the prompt and exhibits superior technical execution.

Please use these guidelines to systematically compare the two models according to the criteria provided.
