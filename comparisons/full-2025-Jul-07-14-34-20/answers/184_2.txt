Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object resembles a square coffee table with consistent form and structure.
   - The right object deviates from a clear square shape and has inconsistencies in form.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears natural and solid, aligning well with normal proportions.
   - The right object shows irregularities and distorted parts.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture aligns well with its geometry across views.
   - The right object has misaligned textures and structure.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures details without blurring, maintaining clarity.
   - The right object appears abstract and lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows organized and efficient geometric detail.
   - The right object has disorganized and noisy geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the left object outperforms the right in alignment, plausibility, and detail.
   - The left one is better.
