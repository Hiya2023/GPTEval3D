Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to have a more complex geometric structure with reflections, though not strictly hexagonal in shape. It suggests reflective properties but does not fully match a hexagonal mirror description.
   - The right model displays a more straightforward hexagonal shape, aligning more closely with the text prompt of "a hexagonal mirror."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has an intricate form which might suggest some ambiguity in structure, potentially making it less solid and more abstract.
   - The right model appears solid, simple, and plausible as a 3D object, with a clear hexagonal structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows varied textures and reflections, providing a richer surface detail.
   - The right model, while structurally clear, lacks the intricate texture details found on the left.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
