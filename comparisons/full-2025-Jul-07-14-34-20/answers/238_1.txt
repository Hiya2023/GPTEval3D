Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (1) displays what appears to be a cylindrical shape that resembles a barrel or container, but it does not align with the description of a "hexagonal table under a round mirror."
   - The right object (2) exhibits a structure that appears more like a table. It has identifiable legs and a surface that could be interpreted as partially hexagonal, though it is not very clear. The image suggests multiple views that might include a reflected or secondary circular object, possibly a mirror.

The right one (2) is better.

Final answer:
2
