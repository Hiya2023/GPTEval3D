Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to have a more intricate and non-standard design, potentially straying from a basic "rectangular bookshelf" description with uneven shelves and unclear structure.
   - The right model clearly shows a simple, rectangular bookshelf design with defined, even shelves.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model seems to have irregular shapes and gaps, giving it an inconsistent structure that doesn't align well with typical bookshelf characteristics.
   - The right model looks more plausible as a 3D object, with solid and consistent shapes found in standard shelves.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has some detailed elements, such as visible book textures, but also appears slightly noisy.
   - The right model, while simpler, maintains consistent and clearer textures that are less noisy.
   - The right one is better.
