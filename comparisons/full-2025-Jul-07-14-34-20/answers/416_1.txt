Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model does not resemble a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal. It looks more like a cushion or cloth-like structure.
   - The right model similarly does not align with the text prompt. It appears more like a complex, organic form but still lacks spherical and cubic elements.
   
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and well-formed, although it does not match the prompt. It lacks strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right model has more irregularities and appears less solid and coherent, with more complex and noisy structures.
   
   Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a more blurred texture but is slightly more detailed in terms of consistent material appearance.
   - The right model has a rougher texture with more visible noise and less realistic detailing.
   
   Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
