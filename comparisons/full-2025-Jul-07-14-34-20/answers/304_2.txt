Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more detailed elliptical top and circular legs, aligning closely with the prompt.
   - The right one has an elliptical shape but less definition in the legs.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and consistent in shape from different angles, with no obvious structural issues.
   - The right one seems less stable, with potential shape inconsistencies.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows more detailed texture and realistic coloring on the legs.
   - The right one lacks sharpness and detail in texture.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
