Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one vaguely resembles a sign but lacks clarity in the triangular shape; the right one clearly has a distinct triangular road sign appearance.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows irregularities and does not look solid; the right one has more natural proportions and appears more solid.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has poor alignment with irregular textures; the right one has better texture alignment with the geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks detail and appears blurry; the right one captures finer details more effectively.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has less distinct geometry with noise; the right one shows more organized geometry with better detail.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one consistently shows better alignment, plausibility, and detail.
The right one is better.
