I'm unable to display or analyze these images directly, but I can offer guidance on how to approach this analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
   - **Left:** Examine if the object looks cubic with a curved base.
   - **Right:** Similarly check if it aligns with a cubic lamp and curved base.
   - Decide based on which one better represents "a cubic lamp with a curved base."

2. **3D Plausibility:** 
   - Assess if both objects appear natural and solid.
   - Look for any irregularities like odd proportions or duplicated parts.
   - Decide based on which model looks more realistic and feasible.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Check if the textures and geometry align.
   - Verify if structures are consistent across RGB and normal maps.
   - Decide based on which has better texture-geometry consistency.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:** 
   - Focus on clarity and detail in textures.
   - Determine if textures are appropriately detailed without blurring.
   - Decide based on which displays finer texture details.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:** 
   - Examine local geometry details in the normal maps.
   - Evaluate the organization and intricacy of these details.
   - Decide based on which has more refined and well-ordered geometry.

6. **Overall:** 
   - Weigh all factors above comprehensively.
   - Decide on overall which model is superior considering alignment, realism, texture, and geometry details.

Once you have analyzed each aspect closely, you can summarize like in the provided format:

Final answer:
1 2 3 1 2 1

This format indicates which object is better in each category. Adjust the numbers based on your findings during analysis.
