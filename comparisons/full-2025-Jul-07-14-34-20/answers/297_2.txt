Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - **Left (Object 1):** The object has a spherical shape and the texture implies a realistic appearance suitable for a doorknob. The details seem consistent with a typical doorknob design.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The object is also spherical with a polished, reflective surface, which is appropriate for a metallic doorknob. The reflections suggest a proper material alignment with a doorknob.

The right one is better as it captures both the spherical shape and the reflective quality which is often seen in metallic doorknobs.

Final answer:
