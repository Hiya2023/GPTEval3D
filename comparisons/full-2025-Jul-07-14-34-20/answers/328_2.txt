Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a rectangular bookshelf with visible shelves and books, meeting the text description.
   - The right model is less defined as a bookshelf, with an unclear shape and structure.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks solid and reasonable with clear shelf structures.
   - The right model has irregular shapes and appears less plausible as a bookshelf.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture is clearer with visible details like books.
   - The right model's texture is noisy and lacks realism.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
