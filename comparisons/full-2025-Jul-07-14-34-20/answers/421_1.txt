I'm unable to directly compare or analyze images, but I can provide some guidance on what you might look for when comparing them according to your criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: The prompt is "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate if this object resembles a sofa or a mirror and how well it captures the rectangular or oval attributes.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Similarly, check if this model reflects a sofa or mirror and matches the shape description.
   - Decide which model aligns better with the concept of a "rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Consider if the model appears solid and reasonable for a 3D object. Look for odd structures or meaningless parts.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Do the same evaluation as for the left, checking for solidity and any irregularities.
   - Determine which model is more likely to accurately represent a 3D object.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Examine the detail and realism of textures. Are they sharp and detailed?
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Compare with the left, focusing on texture clarity and fidelity.
   - Decide which one has the superior texture quality.

### Final Decision:
Based on these considerations, make a decision for each criterion and summarize in the format: `<option for criterion 1> <option for criterion 2> <option for criterion 3>`.
