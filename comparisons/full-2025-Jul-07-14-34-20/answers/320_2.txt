Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model shows an elliptical tabletop and circular legs that align well with the text prompt.
   - The right model also has an elliptical surface and circular legs but appears to show more detail in the structural alignment.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears less defined and somewhat lacks solidity due to its softer edges.
   - The right model looks more solid with clearer, more plausible 3D structures.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture appears bland and less detailed.
   - The right model has sharper textures with more realistic details.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
