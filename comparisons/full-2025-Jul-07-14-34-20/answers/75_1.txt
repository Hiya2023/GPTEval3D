Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one doesn't depict a spherical shape and lacks a flat seat; The right one also lacks spherical characteristics or a recognizable flat seat.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one is more structured and harmonious as a vase shape; The right one has a more abstract and less plausible form.
Left is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with the shape; The right one's texture doesn't align uniformly with its shape.
Left is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has consistent and clear texture details; The right one appears abstract and less focused on details.
Left is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays consistent geometry that aligns with the normal maps; The right one's geometry is erratic.
Left is better.

6. Overall: The left one is more structured and consistent despite not matching the prompt exactly.
Left is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1 1 1 1
