Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one has a yellow triangular shape but feels more like a cloth or banner than a sign.
   - The right one has a clearer triangular shape that more closely resembles an actual road sign, including a striped pole.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears somewhat irregular and resembles fabric or an uneven, soft surface.
   - The right one has a structured and consistent appearance, suggesting a solid, plausible sign.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a rough texture with some visible noise and uneven details.
   - The right one has sharper and more cohesive details, with clearer structural lines.
   - The right one is better.
