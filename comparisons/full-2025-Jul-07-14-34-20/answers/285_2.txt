Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) depicts a lamp with a clear base and cover, but it does not show any sofa or mirror attributes.
   - The right one (object 2) also depicts a lamp, similarly lacking representation of a sofa or mirror.

Both models fail to represent the described objects (rectangular sofa and oval mirror).

Final answer:
