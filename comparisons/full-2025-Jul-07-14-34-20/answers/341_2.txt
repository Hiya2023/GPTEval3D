Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one does not clearly depict a round stool and rectangular sofa. The shapes are ambiguous.
   - The right one appears to have clearer differentiation between two objects, possibly indicating furniture-like forms.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one is irregular and appears flat; it lacks solidity and identifiable structure.
   - The right one shows more plausible shapes, with a slightly better sense of depth and distinct forms.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has some visual noise and lacks detail.
   - The right one appears to have more consistent texture and slightly better detailing.
   - The right one is better.
