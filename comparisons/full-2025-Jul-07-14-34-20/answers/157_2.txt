I'm unable to identify specific objects in the images. However, I can guide you on how to approach the evaluation:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - **Left:** Contains multiple objects which do not align with the "spherical globe on a cubic pedestal" prompt.
   - **Right:** The simpler design aligns less ambiguously with the prompt but also lacks clear spherical and cubic features.
   - **Cannot decide.**

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left:** The objects appear complete but not cohesive, with mismatched elements.
   - **Right:** Appears more unified but lacks distinctive shapes.
   - **Cannot decide.**

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - **Left:** Displays inconsistent texture alignment with geometry, leading to disjointed parts.
   - **Right:** Lacks enough detail to evaluate effectively.
   - **Cannot decide.**

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - **Left:** Displays more detailed textures, though with incorrect object types.
   - **Right:** Less detailed and smooth textures.
   - **Left is better.**

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - **Left:** More detailed but not pertinent to the text prompt.
   - **Right:** Simpler with fewer details.
   - **Left is better.**

6. **Overall:**
   - Despite the left having better details, neither aligns significantly well with the prompt.
   - **Cannot decide.**
