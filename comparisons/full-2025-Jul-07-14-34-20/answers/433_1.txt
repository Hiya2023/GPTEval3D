Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more rounded appearance but does not show a clear triangular form.
   - The right one also lacks a distinct triangular structure.
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and coherent, with no apparent body issues.
   - The right one also looks plausible and solid but appears slightly noisy in texture.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother, more uniform texture.
   - The right one exhibits sharper and more detailed textures.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 2
