Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one does not clearly represent any table or mirror shape.
   - The right one more resembles a hexagonal structure, but neither appears under a round mirror. 
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more like a simple cylinder and less complex.
   - The right one has distinct ridges and more structural complexity, which seems more plausible as an object.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows basic texturing which is not well aligned with geometry.
   - The right one displays more cohesive texture and geometry, with textures following the ridges.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has very basic, almost flat textures.
   - The right one has intricate texture details, visible across the surface.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one lacks detail and shows a simple shape.
   - The right one exhibits more detailed and organized geometric features such as ridges.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right object performs better in all key criteria, showing better alignment, plausibility, and detail.
   The right one is better.
