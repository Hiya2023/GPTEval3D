Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: Features a colorful and vibrant pattern, but has a more irregular shape, not perfectly cubic.
   - The right one: Simpler design, more cubic, and aligns better with the description of "a cubic ottoman."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: The shape appears irregular, and the vibrant patterns are chaotic, reducing plausibility.
   - The right one: Appears more solid and plausible as an ottoman, with a more regular cubic shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Displays high-detail and intricate textures with vibrant colors.
   - The right one: Has smoother and less detailed textures.
   - The left one is better.
