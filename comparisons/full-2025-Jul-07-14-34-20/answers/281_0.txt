Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: Appears as a vertical shelf without any visible clock. It does not resemble a cuboid bookshelf, and there's no indication of a circular clock.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Clearly represents a cuboid bookshelf. However, there is no visible circular clock above it.

The right one is better because it accurately represents a cuboid bookshelf, although neither object accurately fulfills the complete prompt with the clock.

Final answer:
2
