I'm unable to identify objects or make a comparison regarding comparing 3D models to their text description. However, I can give you general insights on how to approach this comparison.

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left:** Appears as a vase with a floral pattern.
   - **Right:** Resembles a lamp with a conical shade and a tapering stand.
   - **Evaluation:** Neither matches the text prompt "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror." Both are unrelated to the description provided.
   - **Decision:** Cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left:** The object seems consistent and complete as a single form, resembling a vase without obvious abnormalities.
   - **Right:** The lamp looks coherent and realistic without any strange or noisy features, maintaining a reasonable structure.
   - **Evaluation:** Both models appear plausible in their forms but are unrelated to the text prompt.
   - **Decision:** Cannot decide.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left:** The floral texture is vibrant and detailed on the surface of the vase, adding realism.
   - **Right:** The lamp's texture appears somewhat less detailed compared to the floral patterns on the vase.
   - **Evaluation:** The texture of the left model is sharper and more detailed.
   - **Decision:** Left (object 1) is better.

### Final Answer:
