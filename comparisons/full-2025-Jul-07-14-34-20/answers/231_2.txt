I'm unable to view the objects in the images provided. Please describe each object, and I can help with the analysis based on your descriptions.

For a complete evaluation, consider factors like:
1. Shape: Is the table hexagonal? Is there a round mirror?
2. Alignment: Are the objects arranged as described?
3. Detail: Are any additional features mentioned in the prompt present?

Once you provide details, I can assist further.
