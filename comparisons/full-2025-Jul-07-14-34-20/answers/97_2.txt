Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more as a traditional bookshelf with vertical sides and shelves.
   - The right one has an irregular shape with extrusions that do not match the "rectangular bookshelf" description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a more solid and stable structure typical of a bookshelf.
   - The right one displays irregularities that make it appear less natural and functional.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left's texture aligns closely with its simple geometry, ensuring coherence between RGB and normal images.
   - The right exhibits texture mismatches due to its complex geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one presents clear and consistent textures suitable for wood.
   - The right one appears to have noisy textures, lacking in clarity.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows a uniform and efficient geometry without unnecessary noise.
   - The right one displays disorganized details with excessive noise.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model more accurately represents a "rectangular bookshelf" with coherent textures and geometry.
   - The left one is better.
