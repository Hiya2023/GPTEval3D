Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more complex shape that doesnâ€™t clearly resemble a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base.
   - The right one more closely resembles a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears to have irregular shapes and parts that do not resemble a solid form.
   - The right one is more coherent and plausible, resembling a stable object.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one's textures are not as clear and detailed.
   - The right one has sharper and more realistic textures.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
