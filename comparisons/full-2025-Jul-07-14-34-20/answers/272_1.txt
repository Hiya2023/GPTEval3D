I'm unable to view or evaluate the images you've provided. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate the 3D objects based on the text prompt "A triangular shelf with round edges."

### Analysis:
1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Check if the object resembles a triangular shelf and has smooth, rounded edges as described. Observe the shape and curvature carefully in the multi-view and normal renderings.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, evaluate if this object corresponds to a triangular shelf with rounded edges. Look for alignment with the prompt's description.

Compare both objects for their overall shape, edge smoothness, and design. Ensure that both objects are being assessed against the same prompt attributes.

### Final Answer:
Reflect on which object better represents all aspects of the text prompt. Use options 1, 2, or 3 based on the comparison.

Since I cannot visually assess them, please use these guidelines to make your decision.
