Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model depicts a table with ornate legs and a frame-like structure on top, which could be interpreted as square, but it lacks a solid top.
   - The right model is a solid, simple square coffee table, aligning well with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has somewhat odd, inconsistent leg designs that might not be fully plausible as a stable table structure.
   - The right model appears more solid and stable as a table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows more detailed and sharper textures on the legs and edges.
   - The right model has a more uniform texture but lacks finer details.
   - The left one is better.
