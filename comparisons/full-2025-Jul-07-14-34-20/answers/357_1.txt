Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a more defined base, giving it the appearance of a typical doorknob. The spherical shape is maintained well.
   - The right model is more minimalist, with a simpler base that might not clearly suggest a doorknob.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model appears solid and structured with a clear base, enhancing its plausibility as a doorknob.
   - The right model, despite being spherical, lacks a distinctive base that could potentially make it less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model displays sharp and detailed textures, especially around the base, which adds to its realism.
   - The right model has smoother textures but lacks the sharpness of details.
   - The left one is better.
