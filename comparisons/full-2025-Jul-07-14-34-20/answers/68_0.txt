1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a circular seat and the legs align with the square base description. The right one lacks a visible square base.  
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more natural with solid proportions and no visible irregularities. The right one appears less detailed and lacks solidity.  
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left model adheres well to its geometry, with details like the circular seat maintained in both RGB and normal maps. The right one shows less alignment between geometry and texture.  
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures colorful details with clarity, while the right one lacks vibrant and clear textures.  
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has well-organized geometry with clear details, whereas the right one seems less detailed in the normal maps.  
The left one is better.
