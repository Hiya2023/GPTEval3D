Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears rectangular with a more defined cylindrical shape for the armrests.
   - The right object has a general sofa appearance, but the armrests are not clearly cylindrical.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has a defined structure that resembles a sofa, with coherent shapes and no obvious anomalies.
   - The right object seems slightly more abstract and lacks clear solid definition.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has visible details and sharper textures on the upholstery and armrests.
   - The right object has a more colorful texture, which lacks definition in details.
   - The left one is better.
