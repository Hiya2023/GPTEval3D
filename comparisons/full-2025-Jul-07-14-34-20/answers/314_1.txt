I'm unable to identify or compare objects to real-world prompts, such as a "rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror," based on the images provided here. The models shown in the images appear to be lamp-like objects, differing from the described text prompt. 

For evaluating objects such as these lamps, here's a potential analysis based on other aspects:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one does not align with the text prompt provided.
   - The right one does not align with the text prompt provided.
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears coherent and lamp-like.
   - The right one also appears coherent and lamp-like.
   Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper textures and more defined details.
   - The right one has less sharp textures compared to the left.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 3 1
