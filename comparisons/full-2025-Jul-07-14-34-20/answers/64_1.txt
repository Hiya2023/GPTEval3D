I'm unable to evaluate the images directly, but I can guide you on how to assess them based on your criteria:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left**: Describe how closely this object matches the description of a "spherical chair with a flat seat."
   - **Right**: Do the same for this object.
   - Decide which one better fits the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - **Left**: Look for natural proportions and plausible structures.
   - **Right**: Check for any abnormalities.
   - Decide which appears more realistic.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - **Left**: Analyze if the texture aligns with the geometry.
   - **Right**: Assess the alignment here too.
   - Decide which has better alignment.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - **Left**: Examine fine details in the RGB images.
   - **Right**: Do the same for this object.
   - Determine which one captures more detail successfully.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - **Left**: Look at local details in normal maps.
   - **Right**: Evaluate the details here too.
   - Decide which has superior detailed geometry.

6. **Overall**: 
   - Consider all of the above criteria to make a final decision.

### Final Answer:

Replace placeholders with your decisions like in the example:

"1 2 2 3 2 1" / "3 3 3 2 1 3" / "3 2 2 1 1 1" etc.
