Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more accurate triangular shape but additional text not mentioned in the prompt. The right one clearly resembles a triangular road sign without unnecessary details.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has irregular geometry with parts that seem disjointed. The right one maintains a consistent triangular shape and appears more realistic.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one exhibits misaligned textures with awkward geometry. The right one shows consistent texture and geometry alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has distracting text and rough textures. The right one has smoother textures with more concise details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a disorganized structure. The right one shows smooth and well-organized geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one consistently reflects the text prompt better, with superior plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, and detail.
The right one is better.
