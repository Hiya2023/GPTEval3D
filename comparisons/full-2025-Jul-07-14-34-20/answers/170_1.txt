Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a red triangular sign, while the right one has a more complex texture with signs and text. The left one better matches the description of a "triangular road sign."
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more straightforward and realistic appearance for a road sign, while the right one is cluttered with text and patterns that are less plausible for a typical triangular road sign.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has consistent alignment between the shape and texture of a road sign. The right one has mismatched textures and shapes that don't align with the expected triangular form.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one maintains clarity and simplicity expected for a road sign, while the right one has overly complex and distracting textures.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows clear geometry with smooth edges, while the right one's geometry is noisy and less defined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one consistently aligns with the criteria better than the right one.
The left one is better.
