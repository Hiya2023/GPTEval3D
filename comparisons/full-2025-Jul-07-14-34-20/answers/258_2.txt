Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- Left (object 1): The model appears to depict a lamp or decorative object rather than a traffic cone and ball. It does not align with the text prompt "A triangular traffic cone beside a circular ball."

- Right (object 2): The model displays a circular object on a stand. There is no representation of a triangular traffic cone, so it also does not align well with the text prompt.

The right one is slightly more aligned as it represents a circular shape, but neither fully captures the described scene.

Final answer:
