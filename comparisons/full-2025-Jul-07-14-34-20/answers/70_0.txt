Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a triangular sign, matching the prompt. The right object is a rectangular sign, which doesn't align with the prompt. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more natural triangular shape despite some irregularities. The right object has abnormal proportions for a road sign.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture aligns well with its triangular geometry. The right object has mismatched textures and shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures more detailed textures, like individual segments on the sign. The right object looks flat and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has more intricate geometry details consistent with a triangular form. The right object has minimal geometric details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object matches the prompt and has better texture and geometry.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
