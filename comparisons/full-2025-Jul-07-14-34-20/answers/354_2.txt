I'm unable to directly provide comparisons for images. However, I can guide you on how to compare:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: Evaluate how well each model matches the description "A circular clock above a cuboid bookshelf." Look for key features such as the clock's shape and position. Determine which model better represents these elements.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Assess the solidity and coherence of each model. Look for issues like floating parts or structural anomalies. Decide which appears as a more believable 3D object.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: Inspect the surface details and realism of the textures. Compare clarity and detail levels.

Summarize your findings with options to determine the better-performing model on each aspect.
