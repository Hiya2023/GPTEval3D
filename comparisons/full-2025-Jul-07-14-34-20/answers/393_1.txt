Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a rectangular shape with cylindrical armrests and cushions.
   - The right model also appears rectangular with armrests, but less prominently cylindrical.
   - The left one is better due to clearer cylindrical armrests.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more structured and plausible as a 3D object.
   - The right model seems less defined and lacks clear structure.
   - The left one is better as it appears more solid and coherent.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has more detailed textures, with visible patterns and defined structure.
   - The right model has a more uniform, less detailed texture.
   - The left one is better due to sharper and more detailed texture.

Final answer:
