Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a hexagonal shape, which aligns well with the prompt "A hexagonal mirror."
   - The right object appears to be more of a complex, diamond shape rather than hexagonal, which does not align as well with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object looks solid and maintains a uniform hexagonal shape with appropriate surface normals.
   - The right object has more complex features but appears less plausible as a simple mirror due to its structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object's texture is smoother but lacks detailing, which can be expected for a simple mirror.
   - The right object's texture has more detail and color, making it sharper, albeit more complex than a typical mirror.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
