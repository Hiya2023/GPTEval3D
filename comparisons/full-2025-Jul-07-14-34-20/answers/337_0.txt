Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: Appears to have a circular seat and a circular base, which does not align with the text prompt of a square base.
   - The right one: Has a circular seat and a square base, matching the text prompt more accurately.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one: Appears stable with a consistent design, but the base is round.
   - The right one: Also looks stable and plausible with a clear square base.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one: The textures are somewhat blended and less distinct.
   - The right one: Displays sharper and more detailed textures.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
