Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model resembles an oval dining table with more clarity, while the right one is less distinct. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural, whereas the right model seems less defined and less plausible. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures and geometry of the left model align better, showing consistency across both RGB and normal images. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer details without being overly blurry compared to the right one. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents more organized and intricate geometry details compared to the right one. 
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model consistently outperforms the right model. 
The left one is better.

Final answer:
