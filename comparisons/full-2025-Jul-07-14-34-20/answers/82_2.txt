Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one accurately represents a hexagonal mirror; the right one shows a triangular shape which may represent the intended triangular frame but misses the hexagonal mirror. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears as a solid hexagon; the right one has a complex shape that does not clearly represent the described object.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows consistent hexagonal shapes between RGB and normal maps; the right one has misaligned textures that disrupt its form.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has a clearer representation of a mirror's reflective qualities; the right one is textured but lacks clarity.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows smoother geometry; the right one has disorganized and noisy details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left one better matches the text description and demonstrates superior plausibility and detail.
   The left one is better.
