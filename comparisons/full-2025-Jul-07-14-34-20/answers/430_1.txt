Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left object has a more structured outline that suggests a tangible shape, possibly resembling a base, but the lampshade appearance is not clear. 
   - The right object has less definition and does not clearly indicate alignment with the "conical lampshade on a cylindrical base" description.
   - The left object is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left object seems to have a coherent form, which could suggest a lamp structure, though the clarity is lacking.
   - The right object lacks a definitive shape and appears more abstract and less plausible as a 3D solid.
   - The left object is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left object shows some additional texture and detail, especially in the base, contributing to a slightly more realistic appearance.
   - The right object appears more uniformly textured but lacks detail.
   - The left object is better.
