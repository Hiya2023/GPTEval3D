Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one resembles a square table more clearly, while the right one looks distorted and doesnâ€™t align well with the prompt. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural as a table. The right model has abnormal proportions and irregular features. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures and geometry of the left model are more consistent, while the right model shows misalignment and distortion. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details without excessive blurriness, while the right one lacks clarity and detail. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has well-organized and smooth geometry, whereas the right model's geometry is noisy and irregular. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria, the left model performs better in alignment, plausibility, and detail representation. The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
