Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a triangular shape which matches the prompt "A triangular road sign".
   - The right one does not resemble a triangular sign but rather a rectangular one.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid with a consistent triangular shape.
   - The right one seems plausible but does not adhere to a triangular form.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows distinct alternating colors, suggesting a detailed texture.
   - The right one's texture is less sharp and appears more generic.
   - The left one is better.
