Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a rectangular road sign; the right one is a triangular road sign.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one has a more solid and plausible structure for a rectangular sign; the right one has a triangular shape and appears realistic.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one's texture aligns with a rectangular structure; the right one has a textured triangular sign with texture accurately mapped.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one's textures are more uniform but not detailed; the right one has clear textures with more distinct details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one has simple geometry; the right one shows more intricate geometry fitting a triangular sign.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one accurately reflects the prompt and has better details.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
