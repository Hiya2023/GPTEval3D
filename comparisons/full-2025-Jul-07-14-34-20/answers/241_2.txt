Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (Object 1) has a more complex structure with mirrored reflections and multiple facets, which indicates complex geometry inconsistent with a simple hexagonal mirror.
   - The right object (Object 2) clearly shows a simple hexagonal shape with a more straightforward reflective surface, aligning closely with the text prompt of "A hexagonal mirror."

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
