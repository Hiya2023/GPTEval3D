Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more abstract and doesn't clearly show a cubic form or a curved base. 
   - The right one has a defined cubic element and a curved structure, aligning more closely with the prompt "A cubic lamp with a curved base."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model lacks clear 3D plausibility due to its indistinct and blurred form.
   - The right model has a more structured form that seems plausible as a lamp with a base.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has very little texture detail, appearing flat and undefined.
   - The right one shows more detail and texture, making it appear more realistic.
   - The right one is better.
