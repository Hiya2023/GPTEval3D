I'm unable to analyze the images directly. However, I can provide guidance on how you can evaluate these criteria based on what you observe in the images.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:** 
   - Examine if either 3D object resembles "a spherical chair with a flat seat."
   - Determine which object more closely aligns with this description in terms of shape and structure.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Imagine assembling a 3D model based on both the RGB and normal maps.
   - Assess if there are any structural issues such as strange shapes, duplication, or noise.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - Focus on the textures and details of each model.
   - Determine which object exhibits sharper, more realistic, and detailed textures.

### Final Decision:

Use the criteria to make a decision based on:
- **1:** Left (object 1) is better
- **2:** Right (object 2) is better
- **3:** Cannot decide (use sparingly)

Let me know your observations, and we can determine the final decision together.
