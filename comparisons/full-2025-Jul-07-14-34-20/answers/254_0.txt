Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

   - The left object appears to have a more abstract shape without clear representation of a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal. It looks like two irregular forms rather than distinct spherical and cubic shapes.
   
   - The right object somewhat represents a structure that could align with a cubic pedestal but lacks a clear spherical element. The details on this model are more intricate but not aligned with the prompt's description of a globe.

The right one is slightly better since it aligns somewhat with a cubic shape, but neither accurately reflects the complete prompt.

Final answer:
2
