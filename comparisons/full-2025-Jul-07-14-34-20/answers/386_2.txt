Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a square coffee table, though it seems slightly distorted and the details of the top surface aren't clear.
   - The right one also looks like a square coffee table and maintains a clearer and more defined square shape with visible legs.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears less coherent with some irregularities, particularly in the top surface and corners, which seem undefined.
   - The right object is more stable, with evenly shaped legs and a more believable 3D structure.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture lacks definition and sharpness, appearing blurry.
   - The right object has clearer textures, with more visible details and realism in the surface and legs.
   The right one is better.
