I'm unable to provide a complete analysis without being able to see the images. However, based on your description, here's how you could analyze such images:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): If the left object's images show a recognizable cylindrical bin next to a rectangular desk, then it aligns well with the description.
   - Right (object 2): If the right object's images also accurately depict the cylindrical bin beside the desk, then it aligns too. If there's less accuracy or missing elements, this would be noted.

Final answer:
1 / 2 / 3

Ensure that both the cylindrical bin and the rectangular desk are clearly distinguishable and positioned correctly, as per the prompt, in each object's images.
