Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clear trapezoidal shape and multiple shelves visibly matching the prompt. The right one also adheres to the description but appears slightly less stable and the shelves are less distinct. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and stable with realistic proportions. The right one looks less balanced with more irregular shapes. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows good alignment between texture and geometry with clear shelf divisions. The right one has textures that do not align as clearly with the geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures realistic wood textures without blurriness. The right one's textures appear slightly less refined and clear. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits organized geometric structures and smooth surfaces for the shelves. The right one has some irregularities and less well-defined shapes. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left one consistently performs better in alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometric details. The left one is better.
