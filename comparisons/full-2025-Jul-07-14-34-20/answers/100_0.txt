Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a cubic shape but with a colorful pattern; the right one is more rounded and has a patchwork texture. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a solid structure, albeit with exaggerated patterns; the right one has an inconsistent shape for an ottoman. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's geometry and texture align fairly well, despite a colorful design; the right one has irregular alignment. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has less detailed and more abstract textures; the right one has more intricate textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother geometry; the right one has more complex and possibly messy geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left one more closely resembles a "cubic ottoman." The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 2 1 1
