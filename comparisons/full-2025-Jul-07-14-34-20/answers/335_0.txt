Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one features a cushion with vibrant floral patterns which suggests a rounded shape but contains some irregularities that might detract from being clearly round.
   - The right one depicts a cushion with a distinct flower-like structure on top, and the overall roundness is clearer.

   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more solid with consistent patterns across views, though certain views show a lack of perfect roundness.
   - The right one has an unusual flower structure on top that seems implausible as a cushion, although the round shape is more consistent.

   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has sharper and more detailed floral textures with clear colors.
   - The right one has more abstract textures, with less emphasis on sharpness and detail.

   The left one is better.
