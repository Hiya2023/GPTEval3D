Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be more of a rectangular form with four legs, lacking the distinct spherical and cubic elements described in the text prompt.
   - The right object also lacks the spherical globe on a cubic pedestal, showing more of a complex structure.
   The left one is better because it aligns slightly closer to a pedestal-like structure.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems more solid and plausible with a coherent structure, even though it's not perfectly aligned with the text prompt.
   - The right object appears to have fragmented and incomplete parts, making it seem less plausible.
   The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a texture that is more consistent and visually coherent, even though it's blurry.
   - The right object has a noisy and less defined texture, with less detail.
   The left one is better in terms of texture.

Final answer:
