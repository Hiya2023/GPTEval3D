Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not show a triangular traffic cone, only a ball; the right one similarly displays only a ball; both do not align well with the prompt.
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more colorful and textured but less natural; the right one looks more plausible with realistic shading.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture does not match well with the geometry; the right one's texture aligns better with the spherical shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more vibrant and detailed textures; the right has smoother, more natural textures but less detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks clear geometric detail; the right has a clearer geometry that matches the sphere.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one offers better alignment with geometry and plausibility, although both miss part of the text prompt.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2 1 2 2
