Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one lacks definition for a "triangular shelf with round edges," while the right one also does not match the description clearly. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one seems fragmented and implausible, while the right one appears more coherent and structured. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one exhibits poor alignment between texture and shape, while the right one shows better consistency between RGB and normal images. 
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is overly abstract and lacks detail, whereas the right one has clearer and more defined textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry appears noisy and disorganized, while the right one presents smoother and more detailed geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model appears more accurate, coherent, and detailed.
The right one is better.
