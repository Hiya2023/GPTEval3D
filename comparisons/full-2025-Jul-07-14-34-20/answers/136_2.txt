Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear hexagonal shape which aligns well with the "hexagonal mirror" part of the prompt.
   - The right one does not clearly represent either a hexagon or a triangular frame.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and natural, resembling a plausible object.
   - The right one lacks clarity in its 3D form and does not resemble a real-world object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has textures that align well with its shape, maintaining consistency.
   - The right one's textures do not match the shape effectively.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures fine details without being blurry, showing a realistic reflection.
   - The right one has incoherent texture details.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has a well-organized and smooth structure.
   - The right model appears disorganized with no clear intricate details.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the left one consistently performs better in alignment, plausibility, texture, and detail representation.
   - The left one is better.
