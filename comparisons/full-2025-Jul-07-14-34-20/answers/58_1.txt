Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model looks very abstract and does not clearly depict a sofa; the right model accurately shows a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears noisy and lacks definitive shape; the right model is more solid and natural, representing a plausible sofa.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures do not align well with its shape; the right model has textures that align smoothly with its geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model shows noisy, undefined textures; the right model displays clear and well-defined textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model is chaotic with indistinct geometry; the right model shows well-organized and smooth geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model consistently outperforms in all criteria.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
