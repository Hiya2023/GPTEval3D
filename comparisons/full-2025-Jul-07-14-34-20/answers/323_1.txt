Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left 3D model resembles a rectangular road sign, which does not align well with the description "triangular road sign."
   - The right 3D model clearly depicts a triangular road sign, matching the text prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left 3D model looks like a plausible, standard road sign with solid structure.
   - The right 3D model appears as a solid and more plausible triangular sign although it has some slight irregularities.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left 3D model has a clearer and more detailed texture on the sign face.
   - The right 3D model has a less sharp texture, but the color is more vivid.
   The left one is better.
