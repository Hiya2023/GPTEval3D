Certainly! Below is the comparison based on the criteria you provided:

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to be a globe and stand, lacking clear elements of a cylindrical bin or a rectangular desk.
   - The right model also resembles a globe on a stand with no obvious features of a cylindrical bin or a rectangular desk.
   - Both models do not align with the original text prompt.
   - Cannot decide which is better based on text prompt alignment.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has distinct edges and shapes which seem coherent but do not represent the described objects.
   - The right model appears to be more structurally complex and cohesive, resembling a more plausible standalone object.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has noticeable texture patterns but lacks clarity.
   - The right model displays more detailed textures and vibrant, realistic colors.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
