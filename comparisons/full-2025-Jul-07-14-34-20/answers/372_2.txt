Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a circular top but a round base, which does not match the "square base" description.
   - The right one also has a circular top and a round base, not aligning with the "square base" requirement.
   - Cannot decide as both fail to represent the prompt correctly.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and consistent across views, with no apparent strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right one has some visible distortions and irregularities, particularly around the base.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother texture but lacks detail and sharpness.
   - The right one has a more detailed and sharper texture, although it appears more noisy.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
