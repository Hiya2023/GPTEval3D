Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a fuzzy texture, which might not fully align with "cubic ottoman." The right one looks more structured and cubic. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less structured, with unclear form. The right one seems more solid and realistic. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a texture that doesn't align well with the geometry. The right one aligns better with the cubic shape. 
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears too abstract, while the right one has clearer details, fitting the prompt. 
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows more irregularities and noise, while the right one is smoother and well-organized. 
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model appears more accurate and plausible based on all criteria.
The right one is better.
