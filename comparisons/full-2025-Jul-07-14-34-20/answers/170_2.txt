Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one reflects a triangular shape, aligning with the prompt "A triangular road sign."
   - The right one has a more complex texture that doesn't clearly depict a triangle as well as the left.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more natural and maintains a consistent triangular shape.
   - The right one has distracting textures, impacting its plausibility.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one’s texture fits the triangular structure.
   - The right one’s textures are less aligned with the geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one maintains a cleaner, more coherent texture.
   - The right one’s textures are more abstract and less precise.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one has consistent and smooth geometry.
   - The right one shows more noise and irregularities.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model represents the prompt better with more plausible geometry and texture alignment.
   The left one is better.
