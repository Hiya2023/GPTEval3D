I'm unable to directly evaluate the images or their contents. However, I can guide you on how to conduct an analysis based on the criteria youâ€™re interested in:

### Analysis

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Describe how closely the shape resembles "a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal." Note the spherical and cubic elements and how well they align with the description.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Do the same for the second object, evaluating the spherical and cubic characteristics.
   - Which one captures the elements of the text prompt better?

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Analyze for solidity and normalcy, checking for logical structures and absence of errors like duplicated parts.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Evaluate similarly, considering the 3D feasibility.
   - Determine which object appears more plausible as a coherent 3D model.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Check the sharpness and realism of textures, assessing fine details and clarity.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Do the same analysis of texture detail and sharpness.
   - Decide which has more realistic and detailed texture work.

### Final Decision
1 = Left is better; 2 = Right is better; 3 = Cannot decide. Choose based on your analysis of the criteria above and conclude with the format "x x x."

Let me know once you've performed the analysis!
