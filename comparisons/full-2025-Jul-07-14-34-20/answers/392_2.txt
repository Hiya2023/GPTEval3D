Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a lamp, and it does not fit the description of a "cylindrical vase with a flared top."
   - The right one resembles a lamp as well but more cylindrical in its base design. However, it still does not match the prompt precisely.
   - Cannot decide as neither aligns well with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one seems to have a solid form but has an unusual construction with a wide top and intricate middle section.
   - The right one appears more structured and visually coherent as a stand-alone object, with a smoother design.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a rougher texture, with less clarity in details.
   - The right one shows sharper textures and more realistic lighting effects, particularly in the lamp shade area.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
