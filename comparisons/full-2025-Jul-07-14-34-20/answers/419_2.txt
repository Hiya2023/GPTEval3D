Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more colorful pattern and appears somewhat cubic, but the pattern is overwhelming and may detract from the shape.
   - The right one is more simplistic in design and shape, aligning closely with the concept of a cubic ottoman.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems structurally sound but the bright patterns can make it seem less cohesive.
   - The right one is solid and plausible, with clear edges and a uniform surface.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has intricate, detailed patterns that stand out vividly.
   - The right one has a smoother, less detailed surface which lacks texture depth.
   - The left one is better.
