Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left object has a circular top and a base that appears to be circular, not square, thus partially aligning with the prompt. 
   - The right object has a circular seat with a square base more visible from the way the legs are structured, better fitting the description.
   - **The right one is better.**

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left object appears cohesive and solid, with consistent design elements across views.
   - The right object seems less stable and slightly distorted, notably at the legs.
   - **The left one is better.**

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left object has clearer and more detailed textures, making it appear more realistic.
   - The right object has less defined textures, appearing more washed out.
   - **The left one is better.**

Final answer:
