Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is mostly spherical, with a textured surface, but doesn't resemble a typical cushion.
   - The right one is round and has a floral pattern that could be fabric-like, resembling a decorative cushion.
   - Right is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has an unusual texture that doesn't appear soft or cushioned.
   - The right one appears round and has a consistent surface, resembling a plausible cushion.
   - Right is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a uniform, low-detail texture.
   - The right one has detailed floral patterns and vibrant colors.
   - Right is better.
