Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to have a hexagonal shape for the lampshade and an intricate base, which might not completely fit the "conical lampshade on a cylindrical base" description.
   - The right model features a shape closer to a conical shade but still with a flat side, and a simple, cylindrical-like base.
   - The right one better represents the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and plausible with a consistent structure.
   - The right model has some inconsistencies, especially in the shade shape.
   - The left one is more plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model displays more detailed textures with intricate patterns on the lampshade and base.
   - The right model has simpler textures, lacking the sharpness and detail seen on the left.
   - The left one has better texture detail.

Final answer:
