Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple, smooth, and uniformly colored round shape, closely resembling a typical cushion.
   - The right one has intricate patterns and multiple colors, resembling a decorative cushion rather than a simple round cushion.
   - The left one is better as it aligns more closely with the text prompt "A round cushion."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears normal and consistent with the shape of a cushionâ€”smooth and solid.
   - The right one appears solid as well but has more complex features that could conflict with a simple cushion design.
   - The left one is better due to its simplicity and plausibility as a basic cushion.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a uniform texture that is somewhat fuzzy, which is typical for a cushion but lacks detail.
   - The right one has a detailed and intricate texture with patterns that are clear and complex.
   - The right one is better for low-level texture due to the detailed and realistic appearance.
