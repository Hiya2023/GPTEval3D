Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a circular top and a square base, which aligns well with the prompt "A circular stool with a square base."
   - The right one has a circular top and a circular base, which does not match the description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks structurally solid and coherent, resembling a plausible stool design.
   - The right one is also plausible but does not have the specified square base.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a sharper and more detailed texture, especially evident in the base structure.
   - The right one appears more blurred and less detailed in comparison.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
