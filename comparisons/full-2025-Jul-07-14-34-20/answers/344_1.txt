Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a spherical shape and resembles a traditional doorknob with a backing plate. 
   - The right object is also spherical and looks like a standalone doorknob.
   - The left one is better because it includes the backing plate, which is more typical for a doorknob.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object has a more defined spherical shape with a clear backing, but some views have inconsistent textures.
   - The right object appears solid and uniform.
   - The right one is better as it appears more complete and plausible as a 3D model.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object shows some noisy textures and lack of detail in certain areas.
   - The right object has a cleaner and more polished texture.
   - The right one is better due to its sharper and more realistic texture.
