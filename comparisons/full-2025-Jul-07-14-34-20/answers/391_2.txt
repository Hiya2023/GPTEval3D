Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a circular top but a circular base, not matching the "square base" requirement.
   - The right one has a circular top with a more square-like base.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and uniform but lacks variety in geometry.
   - The right one looks more stable and realistic with a structured base.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a consistent texture but may appear less detailed.
   - The right one shows more texture variation and detail, especially on the base.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
