Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model does not align with the prompt of "a spherical lamp on a square nightstand" and seems to be a chair.
   - The right model accurately represents a spherical lamp on a square nightstand.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears unrealistic for the given prompt.
   - The right model appears more natural and plausible as a spherical lamp on a nightstand.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture does not align with the geometry for the given prompt.
   - The right model's texture aligns well with the geometric shape of a lamp and nightstand.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's textures do not fulfill the desired aspects for the prompt.
   - The right model captures more suitable texture details for the objects described.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model does not showcase relevant geometry due to the incorrect object.
   - The right model displays a better representation of the intended shapes.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   The right model aligns well with the provided criteria and represents the prompt accurately.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
