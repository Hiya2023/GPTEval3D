Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have a more textured structure, possibly resembling a nightstand with some irregularities, but it doesn't clearly show a lamp on top. 
   - The right object resembles a piece of furniture, possibly a couch. It doesn't match the prompt of a spherical lamp on a square nightstand.
   - Cannot decide, as neither clearly matches the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has a rough and inconsistent shape, with unclear definition which might suggest structural issues.
   - The right object has a more defined and cohesive structure, appearing more normal and solid.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has some texture details but appears noisy and lacks clarity.
   - The right object demonstrates sharper and more realistic texture, with greater detail.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
