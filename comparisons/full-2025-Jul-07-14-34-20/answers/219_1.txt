To compare the two 3D objects based on the given text prompt, consider the following aspects:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - Look for the presence of both a round stool and a rectangular sofa.
   - Check the shape and positioning of the objects to ensure they match the descriptions given in the text prompt.

2. **Evaluation of Each Model:**
   - **Model on the left (3D object 1):** Analyze if it accurately depicts a round stool beside a rectangular sofa.
   - **Model on the right (3D object 2):** Do the same analysis regarding the alignment with the text prompt.

3. **Decision:**
   - Determine which model better aligns with all the attributes described in the prompt.
   - Choose one of the three options: Left (object 1) is better; Right (object 2) is better; Cannot decide.

Using this approach, make a summary of your findings and the final decision.
