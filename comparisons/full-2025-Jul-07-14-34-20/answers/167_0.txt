Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has intricate details but doesn't look spherical; The right one is clearly spherical.  
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears overly complex and less natural; The right one looks more solid and natural as a doorknob.  
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's complex shapes misalign with its texture; The right one's texture aligns well with its simple spherical shape.  
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is detailed but cluttered; The right one is clean and simple, fitting the prompt.  
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has intricate but confused details; The right one captures the smoothness typical of a doorknob.  
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object better represents a "spherical doorknob" in terms of alignment, plausibility, and texture-geometry integration.  
The right one is better.
