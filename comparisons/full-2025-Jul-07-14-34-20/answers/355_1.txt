Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one (object 1) does not appear clearly cubic or lamp-like.
   - The right one (object 2) has a more defined cubic appearance and suggests a base, aligning better with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one (object 1) lacks clear definition and structure, appearing less solid.
   - The right one (object 2) has a discernible structure with solid features, appearing more plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one (object 1) has less detailed texture and appears more blurred.
   - The right one (object 2) shows more detail and sharper textures.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
