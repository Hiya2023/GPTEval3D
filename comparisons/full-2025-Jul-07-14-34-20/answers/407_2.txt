Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to depict a rounded and soft object rather than a "spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - The right one shows a structure with a more distinct separation that might imply different components, closer to the description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems to have an unclear form that doesn't suggest solid or plausible structures, more like a merged soft object.
   - The right object is composed of distinct parts, suggesting more plausible structures.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one's texture appears smoother but lacks distinct details.
   - The right one has more texture detail and differentiation, making it look sharper and more realistic.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
