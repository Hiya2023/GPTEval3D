Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one looks like a square coffee table with a detailed, ornate top and turned legs.
   - The right one also has a square top with turned legs but appears more straightforward and clearer.
   - The right one is better; it more clearly represents "a square coffee table."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has an irregular surface and potentially noisy structure.
   - The right one appears more solid and consistent with typical table features.
   - The right one is better for displaying a more plausible table structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has darker textures, but they are less detailed.
   - The right one has sharper and more detailed textures, contributing to realism.
   - The right one is better for texture clarity and detail.
