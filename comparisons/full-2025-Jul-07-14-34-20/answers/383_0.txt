Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have an elliptical top and circular legs, aligning well with the prompt.
   - The right one also has an elliptical top and circular legs but seems more structured.
   - The right one is better, as it more clearly represents these features.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears less solid and has some irregular texture which impacts its plausibility.
   - The right one looks more normal and solid with clearer structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has less detailed texture.
   - The right one has sharper and more realistic texture details.
   - The right one is better.
