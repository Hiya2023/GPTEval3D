Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts cylindrical objects, not aligned with "a hexagonal table under a round mirror."
   - The right one resembles a table structure, aligning more with “a hexagonal table” concept.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks plausible connections to the described structure.
   - The right one appears more solid and structured, resembling a plausible table.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows misalignment as the texture doesn't represent identifiable features.
   - The right one shows better alignment with textures matching the table structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one’s textures lack detail and clarity.
   - The right one has clearer textures with defined table edges and surfaces.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one's geometry doesn't form recognizable shapes.
   - The right one demonstrates organized details and smooth structure.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one consistently aligns with the prompt and exhibits better 3D construction, geometry-texture adherence, and detail.
   The right one is better.
