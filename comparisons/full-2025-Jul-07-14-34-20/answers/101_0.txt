Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a clear hexagonal shape with a triangular framing visible; the right one is less distinct in frame definition. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more structured and cohesive, with reasonable geometry; the right one shows some irregularities. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture matches its geometric shape more accurately, while the right one shows some misalignment. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has more defined texture details, appearing sharper; the right one looks a bit blurred. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object maintains consistent geometry with intricate surface details; the right one appears to have more noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left object consistently outperforms the right one. The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
