Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a triangular structure, with no clear separation of a circular clock and bookshelf. 
   - The right model appears to be a flat, triangular form, also failing to represent a clear clock and bookshelf. 
   Neither seems to align well with the text prompt of "A circular clock above a cuboid bookshelf."
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more like a solid structure, although it doesn't clearly represent the described objects.
   - The right model appears less plausible as a 3D structure with potential stability or realism issues.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a smoother and more consistent texture.
   - The right model has less detailed and less realistic textures.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
