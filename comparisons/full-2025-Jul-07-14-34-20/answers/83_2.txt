Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more abstract and less cushion-like, while the right one resembles a round cushion in shape and appearance. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has irregular and unrealistic geometry. The right one appears more natural and cushion-like. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s texture does not align well with its shape, while the right one shows a more consistent alignment between geometry and texture. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one’s texture appears noisy and less cohesive. The right one effectively captures fine details and appears more realistic. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one appears chaotic and unorganized. The right one has a more smooth and well-organized structure. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one consistently performs better across all criteria. The right one is better.
