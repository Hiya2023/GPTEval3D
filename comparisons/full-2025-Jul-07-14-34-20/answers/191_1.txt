Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears to show a flat object; The right one shows a round object beside a rectangular one.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks distinct 3D features; The right one presents more defined forms.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left’s geometry and texture don’t align well; The right has a coherent geometry-texture relationship.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left lacks detail; The right has clearer textural details, especially on surfaces.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left is flat with minimal geometry; The right shows more intricate geometric detail.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right one better fulfills the criteria.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
