Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one: Neither a round stool nor a rectangular sofa is clearly visible. The object appears irregular in shape.
   - The right one: Similarly, it doesn't clearly depict a round stool or a rectangular sofa, with the object also appearing irregularly shaped.

Both objects fail to accurately represent the text prompt. 

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
