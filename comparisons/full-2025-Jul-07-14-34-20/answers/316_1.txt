I'm unable to directly analyze images. However, I can guide you on how to approach the comparison with the given aspects. 

For more precise analysis, you would need to inspect each aspect as follows:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Evaluate if it looks like a cylindrical bin and a rectangular desk. Are these shapes recognizable?
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, check for a cylindrical bin and a rectangular desk representation.
   - **Decision:** Determine which better aligns with "A cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk."

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Analyze if the model looks 3D plausible with correct shading and absence of strange geometries.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Do the same inspection to ensure it looks solid and correct in 3D space.
   - **Decision:** Decide which appears more normal, solid, and without oddities.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Observe details in texture, sharpness, and realism in RGB images.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Compare similarly for texture details and realism.
   - **Decision:** Assess which has sharper and more detailed textures.

### Final Answer:
Based on your manual inspection, decide:

- Use "1 2 2" if the left is better for alignment, but right is better for plausibility and texture.
- Use "2 1 1" for the opposite scenario where right is better for alignment, but left for the others.
- Use "3" only if you are truly unable to decide for a particular criterion.

This structured approach should help you systematically compare and evaluate each aspect of the models.
