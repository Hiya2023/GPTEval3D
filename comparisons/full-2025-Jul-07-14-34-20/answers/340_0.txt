Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one appears to be a lamp with a spherical bottom and a conical shade on top. It doesn't correspond well to the prompt describing "a triangular traffic cone beside a circular ball."
   - The right one depicts a circular golden ball on a stand with a spotlight effect, aligning more with the description of a "circular ball."
   - The right one is better in terms of text prompt alignment as it somewhat represents a circular ball.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one, being a lamp, is a coherent structure and appears solid and plausible as an object, although it does not match the prompt.
   - The right one looks plausible as a sphere, though the shadowing and base might be a bit unusual, but it remains largely believable as a structure.
   - Cannot decide, as both objects are plausible within their own contexts.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one appears to have smoother and more polished textures, with a better definition in the material rendering of the lamp.
   - The right one has some detailed texture on the sphere but less detail on the base, making it slightly less sharp in comparison.
   - The left one is better in terms of texture detail.
