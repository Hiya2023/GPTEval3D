Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left object has an uneven and irregular shape, which does not align well with the idea of a bookshelf. The right object better resembles a rectangular bookshelf with clearer and more distinct shelf levels. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears distorted and lacks a coherent structure, not forming a plausible 3D model. The right object has a more recognizable shape and consistent structure for a bookshelf.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left object's texture appears rough and lacks realistic detail. The right object has a more varied and detailed texture, making it visually more appealing.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
