I'm unable to identify specific attributes or people in images, but I can help analyze the elements you described. 

Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: The left object resembles a circular clock, while the right object seems to be an abstract, textured form that doesnâ€™t clearly match the description of a "rectangular laptop beside a circular mousepad." Neither aligns well with the prompt, but the left is closer due to its circular nature.
   
   **The left one is better.**

2. **3D Plausibility**: The left object looks like a solid, plausible 3D shape (it resembles a coherent circular object), while the right object appears abstract and fragmented, with strange elements that don't form a solid, understandable 3D model.
   
   **The left one is better.**

3. **Low-Level Texture**: The left object displays clearer, more cohesive textures with identifiable details (clock face and hands), while the right object's texture is chaotic and lacks clarity.
   
   **The left one is better.**

Final answer:
1 1 1
