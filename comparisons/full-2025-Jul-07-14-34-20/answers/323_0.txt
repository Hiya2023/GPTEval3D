Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one represents a rectangular road sign with text and arrows. 
   - The right one is a red triangular shape, closer to the prompt "A triangular road sign."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a plausible solid appearance, but doesn't fit the prompt.
   - The right one looks like a triangular sign, but the textures make it seem less solid.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more defined textures and details, especially in the sign's text and arrows.
   - The right one has a simpler texture with less detail.
   - The left one is better.
