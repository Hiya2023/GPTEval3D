Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a hexagonal mirror with vivid surroundings; The right one has a hexagonal mirror that aligns more closely with the plain triangular frame requirement.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has some irregularities and complex color structures; The right one appears more natural and solid.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left one doesn't align well with the hexagonal shape; The right one has a consistent texture with the shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has detailed but noisy textures; The right one has clear, simple details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left oneâ€™s details appear confusing; The right one is well-organized and smooth.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one fulfills the prompt and visual requirements more effectively.
The right one is better.
