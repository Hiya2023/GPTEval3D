Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a detailed, ornate design and is less spherical, while the right object is a simple sphere, which matches the "spherical doorknob" description accurately.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object shows intricate details and looks more decorative but less natural as a typical doorknob. The right object's simplicity makes it look more plausible as a real-world spherical doorknob.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object has textures that follow the geometry well but don't align with a spherical doorknob. The right object's textures align well with its spherical shape, maintaining the intended form.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has intricate, detailed textures. The right object has simpler textures but they are suitable for a spherical shape.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits complex details, while the right one lacks intricate features but maintains a smooth, spherical form.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all criteria and the prompt for a "spherical doorknob," the right object's simplicity and alignment with the description make it a better fit.
The right one is better.
