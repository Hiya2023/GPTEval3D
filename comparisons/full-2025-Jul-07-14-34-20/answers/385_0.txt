Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears as a cylindrical object with a flat top, which doesn't match the "hexagonal table under a round mirror" prompt.
   - The right model is similarly cylindrical, lacking any distinct hexagonal or mirror features.
   - Cannot decide since neither model aligns with the text prompt describing a hexagonal table and a round mirror.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has defined edges, appearing slightly more solid and tangible.
   - The right model looks softer and less defined, with some indistinct features.
   - Left (object 1) is better for overall solidity and clarity.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has sharper, more distinct colors and textures.
   - The right model's texture appears more blurred and less detailed.
   - Left (object 1) is better for sharper and more detailed textures.

Final answer:
