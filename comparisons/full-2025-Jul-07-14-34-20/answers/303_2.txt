I'm unable to visually analyze the content of the images or directly compare them. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate the aspects.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - **Describe the Models**: 
     - **Left (Object 1)**: Does this resemble a rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror?
     - **Right (Object 2)**: Does this resemble a rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror?
   - **Evaluation**: Determine how well each model aligns with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - Examine normal and RGB images for each object.
   - Check for irregularities such as strange body problems, duplication, or meaningless structures.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - Focus on the texture details in the RGB images.
   - Look for sharpness, realism, and detail in each model's texture.

### Decision Making:
Based on your analysis, decide which object is better at each criterion using the three options provided. Then summarize your final decision in the requested format.

If you need help with a hypothetical example response once you've done your analysis, I can assist!
