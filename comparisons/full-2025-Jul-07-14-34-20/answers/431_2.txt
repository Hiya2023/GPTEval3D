I'm unable to view or process images directly in this format. However, I can guide you on how to analyze the 3D objects based on the criteria provided. Here's a methodology you might follow:

### Analysis

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Check if the object is triangular as described in the prompt.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Check if the object is triangular as described in the prompt.
   - Determine which object better represents a "triangular road sign."

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Look for any irregularities like strange shapes or duplicated parts.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Analyze for similar issues.
   - Decide which object appears more structurally plausible.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Examine the sharpness and detail of textures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Do the same here.
   - Determine which object has more realistic and detailed textures.

### Final Decision
Summarize your findings based on individual criteria decisions:

- Text prompt & 3D Alignment: Left/Right/Can't decide
- 3D Plausibility: Left/Right/Can't decide
- Low-Level Texture: Left/Right/Can't decide

### Example:
"1 2 2" means Left is better for 1, Right is better for 2 and 3.
