Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left one describes a simple hexagonal shape that matches the text prompt fairly directly. 
   - The right one seems more complex and decorative, incorporating elements beyond what is specified in the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - The left one appears more consistent with the concept of a singular, solid structure, with less complexity and distortion.
   - The right one, while visually interesting, contains numerous additional structures that seem less plausible for a "hexagonal mirror."
   - The left one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 
   - The left one has a simpler and somewhat blurred texture.
   - The right one has more intricate details and appears crisper, with more visual interest.
   - The right one is better.
