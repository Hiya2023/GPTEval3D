Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model does not resemble a cubic lamp; it looks more like a display. The right model has a more cube-like shape but lacks a distinct curved base.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a more solid and coherent appearance, while the right model appears less stable and incomplete.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better coherence between texture and geometry. The right model's texture does not well align with its shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clearer textures and more defined details, whereas the right model's textures appear less distinct.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more organized geometry and smoother surfaces. The right model's geometry appears less defined and more chaotic.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model appears more solid, coherent, and detailed, despite not perfectly matching the prompt specification.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
