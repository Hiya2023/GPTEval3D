Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a square coffee table with a simple design, albeit less detailed.
   - The right model is also a square coffee table but has more elaborate textures and a more defined, intricate design.
   - The right one is better because it reflects a clear interpretation of "a square coffee table" with detailed design elements.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more solid but is quite dark and lacks detail, making it less visually understandable.
   - The right model appears more robust and realistic, with clear details and no visible duplication or strange structures.
   - The right one is better as it has a more plausible and coherent 3D rendering.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture is quite blurry and lacks detail.
   - The right model shows sharper textures with more intricate details, such as wood grain patterns.
   - The right one is better because its textures are more realistic and detailed.
