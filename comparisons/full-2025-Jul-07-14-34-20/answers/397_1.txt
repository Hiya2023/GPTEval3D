Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
The left one is a vase-like shape with no indication of a flat seat. The right one is similar, without a flat seated element.
Both fail to align with the prompt of "a spherical chair with a flat seat."
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
The left one appears more uneven and less cohesive, while the right one seems smoother and more structured.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
The left one has a more diffuse and blurry texture. The right one appears to have sharper and more defined textures.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
