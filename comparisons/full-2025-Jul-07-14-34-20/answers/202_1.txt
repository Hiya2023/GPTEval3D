I'm unable to directly evaluate the images provided. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the text prompt "A triangular shelf with round edges."

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:**

   - **Left (Object 1)**:
     - Check if the object resembles a triangular shelf.
     - Verify if the edges appear rounded according to the description.

   - **Right (Object 2)**:
     - Look for a triangular shelf shape.
     - Ensure the object has round edges as specified.

If one model better represents a "triangular shelf with round edges" by clearly exhibiting these characteristics, then it would be the better fit.

**Final Decision:**
1. Choose the one that closely resembles the prompt.
2. If both fulfill the prompt equally or neither does, you may choose "Cannot decide" sparingly.

Based on your observations, you can fill out the evaluation according to which model aligns best with the text description.
