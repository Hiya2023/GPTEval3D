I'm unable to provide a definitive answer as I can't view the specifics of the 3D models or images. However, I can guide you on how to conduct a comparison based on the three criteria you mentioned:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: Examine each model to see how well they match the description "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal." Determine if the models clearly represent both the spherical globe and the cubic pedestal as described.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Evaluate the models for solid structure without strange features or duplicated parts. A plausible model should exhibit a coherent structure that makes sense in three dimensions.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: Focus on the detail and realism of the textures. The texture should be sharp and realistic, with clear details that enhance the visual appeal of the model.

Based on these evaluations, choose which model excels in each category. Once you finish your own comparison, summarize your final decision in the format "x x x" as per the example.
