Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a rectangular road sign with a pole. 
   - The right object is more triangular and resembles a typical triangular road sign. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks more structured and solid, with a clear pole and sign design.
   - The right object looks unusual with some unclear shapes and less plausible structure.
The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has clearer text and distinct textures.
   - The right object has less detailed textures and appears more abstract.
The left one is better.
