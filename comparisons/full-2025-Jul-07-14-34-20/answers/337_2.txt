Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a circular seat and a circular base, which does not align with the "square base" in the text prompt.
   - The right one has a circular seat and a more polygonal base structure, closer to the idea of a square base.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks straightforward with simple shapes, making it seem reasonably plausible, although the base is not square.
   - The right one also seems solid and plausible, with its base fitting more appropriately to the text description.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has less detailed texture, with a relatively flat appearance.
   - The right one appears to have more texture detail, especially on the base, making it look more realistic.
   The right one is better.
