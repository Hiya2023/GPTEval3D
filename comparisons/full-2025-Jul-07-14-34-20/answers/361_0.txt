Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a circular top and a circular base, which does not match the text prompt of having a square base.
   - The right model has a circular top with a somewhat squared base area but not distinctly square legs.
   - The right one is closer to the text prompt and thus better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid and structurally plausible, though its base does not match the text prompt.
   - The right model has a less plausible base, with potentially unstable, slanting legs.
   - The left one is better in terms of structural plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a more detailed texture, with visible patterns on the circular parts.
   - The right model's texture appears more blurred and less detailed.
   - The left one is better in terms of texture sharpness and detail.

Final answer:
