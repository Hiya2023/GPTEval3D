Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a circular seat but does not clearly show a square base.
   - The right one has a circular seat with more variation and hints of a sturdy base, though still not clearly square.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears more solid and symmetrical without strange features.
   - The right object looks less stable and has some irregularities in structure.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a more defined texture with noticeable details.
   - The right object appears more washed out with less texture detail.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
