Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model does not resemble a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal, while the right model does not either. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model doesn't represent natural or recognizable objects. The right model, while not a globe, maintains a more solid appearance. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures do not align well with its geometric features. The right model is more cohesive in this regard.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model lacks fine detail in textures. The right model presents a more detailed surface texture.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has geometry that lacks definition. The right model shows more intricate and organized geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right model is more coherent and plausible despite not matching the prompt.
The right one is better.
