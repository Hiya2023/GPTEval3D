Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears round and lacks distinctive oval features, aligning less clearly with the "oval dining table" description.
   - The right object demonstrates an oval shape and closely aligns with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems sturdy but has some indistinct features in the base.
   - The right object appears more structurally plausible and typical for a table, with clear legs and an understandable design.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a more uniform and less detailed texture.
   - The right object displays more detailed and sharper textures, especially on the tabletop.
   - The right one is better.
