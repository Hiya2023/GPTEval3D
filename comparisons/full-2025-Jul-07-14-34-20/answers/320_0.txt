Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have an elliptical tabletop and legs that could be interpreted as circular from certain angles.
   - The right object also has an elliptical tabletop with circular legs that are more distinctly visible.
   - The right one is better in capturing the details of the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears to have a more uniform structure without visible irregularities.
   - The right object looks plausible but may have slight complexity in the details.
   - The left one is better because it seems more solid and clean.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's textures appear less detailed and slightly blurry.
   - The right object's textures are sharper and more detailed.
   - The right one is better in terms of texture realism and detail.

Final answer:
