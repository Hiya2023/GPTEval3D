Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left model has a circular seat and a clear square base, which aligns well with the prompt. The right model has a circular seat but lacks a definitive square base, appearing more rounded. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears stable with distinct structures, while the right model seems solid but has a less defined base. Both have plausible 3D forms, but the left model maintains better definition with no strange elements. The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The right model has slightly sharper and more realistic textures, particularly noticeable on the seat, whereas the left model's textures are less detailed. The right one is better.

Final answer:
