Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple square table, closely matching the prompt.
   - The right one has ornate legs and more detail that isn't specified in the prompt.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid and natural with simpler geometry.
   - The right one, despite more detail, appears less stable.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has consistent geometry and texture.
   - The right one shows misalignment, especially at the legs.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one is clear but slightly flat, lacking texture detail.
   - The right one has more texture detail but is less consistent.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has simple but coherent geometry.
   - The right one has intricate details but is noisier.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one better reflects the prompt and has a more coherent appearance:
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 2 1 1
