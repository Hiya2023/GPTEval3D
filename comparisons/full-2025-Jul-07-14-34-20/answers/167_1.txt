Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has multiple decorative elements and isn't purely spherical, while the right one matches the description of a simple spherical doorknob. 
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears intricate and complex with potential irregularities, while the right one is a simple sphere, appearing more plausible and natural.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture is more aligned with the complex shape, while the right one's simple geometry aligns well with its simple texture.
   - Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has more intricate details, while the right one is very simple and lacks fine texture.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows more intricate geometric details, while the right one is plain with minimal detail.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering alignment with the text prompt and overall plausibility, the right one is better.

Final answer:
