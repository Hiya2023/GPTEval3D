Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a more complex shape, which could detract from the spherical simplicity in the prompt.
   - The right one is simpler and closely matches the idea of a spherical doorknob.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has more intricate structures that seem less natural for a doorknob.
   - The right one maintains a clean, plausible, solid round shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows a mismatch between texture complexity and geometric form.
   - The right one has textures that align well with its simplified spherical form.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has detailed textures but might appear overly complex.
   - The right oneâ€™s textures are finer and more suitable for the object described.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one displays excessive details that might introduce noise.
   - The right one is smooth, with minimal noise, aligning with the intended simple shape.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all factors, the right model aligns better with the prompt and 3D modeling criteria.
   - The right one is better.
