I'm unable to view or analyze specific images directly. However, I can guide you on how to perform the analysis yourself:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Examine if the object looks like a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal. Check for a clear spherical shape atop a cubic base.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, determine if the object shows a spherical globe sitting on a cubic pedestal.
   
   Consider which of the two better represents the prompt description.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Imagine the object in three dimensions. Look for any unusual shapes, inconsistent geometry, or unrealistic elements that don't align well with the idea of a solid model.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Do the same examination for the other object and determine which appears more feasible as a solid 3D model.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Focus on the texture details. Are they sharp, clear, and realistic looking?
   - **Right (Object 2):** Assess the textures similarly for clarity, detail, and realism.

Finally, decide which object performs better for each criterion without letting one aspect influence the others.

### Final Decision:

After your analysis, summarize your choices in the format:
"x x x" (for example, "1 2 2" if left is better for the first criterion, right for the second and third).
