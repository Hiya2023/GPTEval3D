4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one’s textures are cleaner and not blurry. The right one’s textures are more complex but lack clarity.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a smoother structure with no noise. The right one is more intricate but shows unnecessary noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one displays a clearer and more accurate model according to the prompt and appearance criteria.
The left one is better.
