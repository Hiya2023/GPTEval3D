Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a vague structure that doesn't clearly depict a sofa, especially lacking distinct cylindrical armrests.
   - The right object depicts a rectangular sofa with prominent cylindrical armrests more clearly.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears noisy and lacks solid structure, making it less plausible as a 3D model.
   - The right object has a more defined and realistic structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's textures do not align well with any discernible geometry.
   - The right model exhibits better alignment between its textures and geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has indistinct and noisy textures.
   - The right object has clearer textures that align with the model's shape.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model's geometry is unclear and lacks detailed definition.
   - The right model has more detailed and well-defined geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the right object consistently aligns better with the text description, maintains solidity, and presents better geometric and texture details.
   - The right one is better.
