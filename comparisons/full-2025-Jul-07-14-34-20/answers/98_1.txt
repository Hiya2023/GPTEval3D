Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has some irregularities and does not closely resemble a rectangular bookshelf; the right one has an appropriate rectangular shape and structure. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less stable and realistic; the right one is more solid and plausible with a coherent structure. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has misaligned textures and distorted geometry; the right one has better alignment between textures and shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has noisy and unclear texture details; the right one maintains clearer texture details. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows irregular and noisy geometry; the right one displays a more smooth and organized structure. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one is consistently better.
