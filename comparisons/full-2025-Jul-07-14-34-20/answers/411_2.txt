Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more typical vase shape with a narrower neck and wider body, which does not align well with the simple concept of a cylindrical vase.
   - The right one is a straightforward cylinder, aligning well with the text prompt "A cylindrical vase."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and well-structured, despite not being strictly cylindrical.
   - The right one is more cylindrical but seems to have visual noise and a less solid appearance.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more detailed and realistic texture with defined gradients and patterns.
   - The right one appears noisy and less defined in texture details.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
