Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is a simpler square table with a basic design, consistent with the prompt "A square coffee table."
   - The right model appears more ornate with detailed carvings, which might deviate from a straightforward interpretation of the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more solid and plausible as a functional table. It has a stable structure with clear legs and a defined tabletop.
   - The right model, while artistic, seems less stable with its intricate leg design and may not appear as solid.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's textures appear smoother and less detailed.
   - The right model shows more detailed textures, with intricate patterns and colors on its surface.
   - The right one is better.
