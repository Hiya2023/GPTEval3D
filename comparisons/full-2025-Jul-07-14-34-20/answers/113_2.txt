I'm unable to display or analyze the images directly to compare 3D objects. However, I can help by providing guidance on how to evaluate them based on the criteria outlined. 

If you want to assess two 3D objects, hereâ€™s a guide based on your criteria:

1. **Text prompt and Asset Alignment:**
   - Compare how well each object matches the description "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror".
   - Consider the shape, size, and arrangement of the objects described.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Evaluate the natural appearance and realism.
   - Look for any unusual proportions or duplications.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Check if textures naturally follow the shapes in the model.
   - Ensure consistency between RGB and normal maps.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Focus on texture clarity and detail.
   - Check for any blur or lack of detail.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Inspect the fine geometric details in the normal maps.
   - Look for well-structured and organized details.

6. **Overall Decision:**
   - Compare your findings to conclude which model is better based on the above criteria.

If you describe or provide details about the objects, I can offer more specific advice!
