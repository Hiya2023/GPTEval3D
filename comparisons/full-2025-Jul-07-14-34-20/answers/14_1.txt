Analysis:
1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one looks more irregular in shape and pattern, while the right one has a clearer cubic shape and plaid texture aligning with "a cubic ottoman." The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more chaotic and less stable, while the right one has a more solid cubic form. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left shows colorful, abstract textures not aligned with geometry, whereas the right has consistent plaid patterns with geometric features. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left has intricate but overly abstract textures, while the right displays clear textures fitting the structure. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left exhibits noisy geometry, whereas the right shows more coherent detailing in line with a cubic shape. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one maintains better alignment with the prompt, has enhanced plausibility, and improved texture and geometry details. The right one is better.
