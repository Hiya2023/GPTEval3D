Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has intricate details not mentioned in the prompt, while the right one captures the spherical shape effectively.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has complex shapes that appear less doorknob-like, while the right object maintains a realistic and solid spherical form.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s texture doesn’t align well with its complex geometry. The right one shows consistent spherical texture alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has more detailed textures, but they may be overly ornate. The right object captures a simpler, clearer texture matching the prompt.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has excessive decorative details, while the right one maintains clear and simple spherical geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right one captures the prompt more faithfully and naturally.
The right one is better.
