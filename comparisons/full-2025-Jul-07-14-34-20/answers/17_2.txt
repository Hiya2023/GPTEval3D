Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has a clear trapezoidal shape when viewed from the front, fitting the description of a trapezoidal bookshelf well. 
   - The right model also appears trapezoidal but is less clear from the views provided, especially in the side views.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more stable and structured, with distinct shelves and a coherent form.
   - The right model shows some irregularities and seems less solid.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model’s textures and geometry align well, with clear patterns on both the RGB and normal maps.
   - The right model shows some misalignment, with textures not perfectly following the geometric structure.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model exhibits detailed textures that are crisp and well-defined.
   - The right model’s textures are less clear and appear somewhat muddled.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has consistent geometric details that are smooth and well-defined.
   - The right model appears rougher and less organized in the normal maps.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the left model consistently outperforms the right across all evaluated aspects.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
