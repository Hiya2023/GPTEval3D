I'm unable to directly compare the models as you described. However, I can provide you with a framework to do the evaluation based on the aspects mentioned. Here is how you could approach it:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Describe the structure and identify whether it resembles "a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal".
   - **Right (object 2)**: Do the same as above for the second model.
   - **Comparison**: Determine which one better matches the description in terms of shape and form.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Assess the solidity and structure. Check for irregularities like strange shapes or noisy structures.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Evaluate similarly for the second model.
   - **Comparison**: Decide which model appears more realistic and structurally sound.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Examine texture sharpness and realism.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Do the same for the second model.
   - **Comparison**: Evaluate which model has finer and more detailed textures.

### Final Decision:
- Combine your evaluations for each criterion and decide which option corresponds to each model using the listed options (`1`, `2`, or `3`).

Following this framework will help you make a thorough evaluation based on the criteria provided.
