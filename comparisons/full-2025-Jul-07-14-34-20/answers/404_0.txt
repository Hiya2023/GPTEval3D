Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a simple square table structure with four distinct legs and a flat top. It aligns well with the prompt "A square coffee table".
   - The right one, while square, has more elaborate textures and ornate legs, which might encompass more than a basic coffee table.
   
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a plausible structure with no strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right one, though more detailed, has a more complex shape that could be seen as less conventional for a coffee table, but it does not present any strange body problems or duplicated parts.
   
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more uniform texture but lacks fine detail.
   - The right one has sharper, more detailed textures and appears more realistic, especially in the rendering of wood patterns and the ornate legs.
   
   The right one is better.
