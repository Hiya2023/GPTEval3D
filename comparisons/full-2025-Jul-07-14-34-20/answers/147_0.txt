Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one correctly depicts a hexagonal shape but lacks a triangular frame; The right one also shows a hexagon but lacks a clear triangular frame.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more solid and plausible, with a consistent shape; The right model has variations in structure, appearing less stable.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better alignment between geometry and texture, with consistent shapes; The right one displays some misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clear and defined edges and textures; The right one appears more abstract and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one maintains smooth and well-organized surfaces; The right one shows more irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one matches the criteria more closely across categories.
The left one is better.
