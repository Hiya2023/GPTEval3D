I'm unable to see the details of the images, but I can guide you through the evaluation process.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left model seems to depict a lamp, while the prompt specifies "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror.” This model does not align with the text prompt.
   - The right model also depicts a lamp, which also does not fit the prompt of "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror.”
   
   Both models do not align with the text prompt. Cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left lamp appears to have a consistent and plausible shape with no apparent strange structures or duplications.
   - The right lamp also appears consistent, but might have more texture detail that can sometimes indicate over-complications.
   
   Both models appear plausible, but without distinct 3D implausibility to evaluate, cannot decide.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left model’s texture appears clean and simple, focusing more on uniform coloring.
   - The right model’s texture shows more variations and detail, which can appear sharper and more realistic.
   
   The right one has more detailed textures. Right (object 2) is better.
