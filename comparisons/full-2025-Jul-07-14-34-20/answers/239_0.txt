I'm unable to provide a comparison without visual input. However, here's a suggested framework for evaluating the 3D objects based on the text prompt of "A round stool beside a rectangular sofa":

Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe the shape and positioning accuracy according to the text prompt, noting if there's a round and a rectangular shape. 
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Similarly, evaluate the presence of round and rectangular shapes and their alignment as per the prompt.
   - Decide based on which models more accurately reflect the specified shapes and their arrangement.

Final answer:
1 / 2 / 3

Please describe the models or provide images to proceed with the analysis.
