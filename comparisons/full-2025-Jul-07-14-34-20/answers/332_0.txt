Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have a more prominent triangular frame surrounding a mirror-like interior, aligning closely with the description of a "hexagonal mirror with a triangular frame."
   - The right object seems to resemble a hexagonal shape without a clear triangular frame.
   
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks cohesive with a well-defined structure, while the right object seems irregular and less defined in its shape.
   - There are no visible strange body problems, duplicated parts, or noisy structures in the left object, whereas the right object appears more abstract and less solid.
   
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object exhibits sharper and more detailed textures, suggesting a more realistic rendering.
   - The right object's textures appear less distinct, making it seem less realistic.
   
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
