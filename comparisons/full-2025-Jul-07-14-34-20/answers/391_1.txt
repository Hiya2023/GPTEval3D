Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a circular top with a circular base, not aligning well with the "square base" in the prompt. 
   - The right one has a circular top and what appears to be a more angular or square-like base, aligning better with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks solid and plausible, with consistent shapes.
   - The right one also appears normal and plausible, with clear and distinct parts.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a detailed wooden texture, appearing sharper and more realistic in the multi-view images.
   - The right one has a smoother texture which is less detailed.
   - The left one is better.
