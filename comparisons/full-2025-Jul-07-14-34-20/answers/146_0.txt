Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more cubic and simple, whereas the right one has additional textures and patterns. The prompt specifies "a cubic ottoman," which suggests simplicity and cubical shape. The left one is better aligned with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model's proportions and shape look more consistent with a simple ottoman design, while the right one seems more complex and less natural. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows good alignment between the simple geometry and the corresponding texture. The right one has a mismatch with detailed texture that doesn't match its geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right model captures more detailed textures, although it may not fit the intended simplicity. However, in terms of capturing fine details, the right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents a more smooth and clean geometry, which might be more visually pleasing for a simple cubic ottoman. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns better with the prompt and appears more plausible and consistent in structure.
