Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a circular top but not a square base, while the right object has a square base, which matches the prompt. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears to have more consistent proportions and structure, while the right one appears slightly distorted. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures align well with the geometry, while the right one has some minor discrepancies. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object shows clearer texture details, whereas the right one is less defined. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits more intricate and organized geometry details. The left one is better.

6. Overall: Balancing the criteria, the left object's overall execution in realism and detail is superior. However, the right object aligns better with the specific prompt attribute of a square base.

Final answer:
