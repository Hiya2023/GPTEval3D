Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not resemble a stool or sofa; the right one resembles a laptop on a mat, which also doesn't match. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks detail and recognizable shape; the right one represents a recognizable object but not a stool or sofa.
Right is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has mismatched texture and shape; the right one aligns texture and shape, albeit of the wrong object.
Right is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks detail; the right one captures intricate details, though not as required.
Right is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is simple with obvious noise; the right one has more structure but also unrelated to the prompt.
Right is better.

6. Overall, the right one is more structured and aligned, despite incorrect representation. 
Right is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2 2 2 2
