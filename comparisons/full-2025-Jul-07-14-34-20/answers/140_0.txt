Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one depicts a nightstand without a lamp; The right one includes both a spherical lamp and a square nightstand.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks like a distorted nightstand; The right one has more realistic proportions with a clear lamp and nightstand shape.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has some discrepancies between texture and shape; The right one shows better alignment between textures and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is blurry and lacks detail; The right one captures more detailed textures, especially on the nightstand.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is less organized with chaotic geometry; The right one has smoother and more detailed geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model better matches the description, appears more plausible and detailed.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
