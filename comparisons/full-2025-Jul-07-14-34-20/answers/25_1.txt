I'm unable to directly analyze images for this specific task.

However, based on the prompt "A hexagonal table under a round mirror," you can evaluate the models yourself by following these general points:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Identify which model clearly represents both a hexagonal table and a round mirror, reflecting the described shapes and relations.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Look for natural and solid representations of the table and mirror without irregularities.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Ensure the textures align with the geometry. The hexagon and circle should be consistent in shape and texture.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Evaluate which model captures fine, realistic details in the textures of the table and mirror surfaces.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Look for clean and detailed geometry, especially in the hexagon and circle shapes.

6. **Overall**: Consider all aspects to decide the better overall model.

If you'd like more guidance on evaluating these images, just let me know!
