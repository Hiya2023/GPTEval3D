Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a hexagonal shape with more defined edges and a hint of a surrounding frame, aligning more closely with a "hexagonal mirror with a triangular frame."
   - The right one lacks distinct features of a hexagonal shape and does not clearly possess a triangular frame.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to be a more coherent and solid structure without any apparent anomalies.
   - The right one seems uneven and lacks a definite structure that resembles a mirror or frame.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a visibly clearer texture with subtle details around the edges.
   - The right one appears more blurry and lacks visible texture details.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
