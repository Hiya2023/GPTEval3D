Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model features a sofa with a rectangular shape and cylindrical armrests, aligning well with the prompt.
   - The right model also has a rectangular shape but the armrests aren't distinctly cylindrical.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid and consistent, with no visible distortions.
   - The right model also looks plausible but slightly less defined in structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a detailed, sharp texture with clear patterns.
   - The right model displays a colorful texture but lacks finer details.
   - The left one is better.
