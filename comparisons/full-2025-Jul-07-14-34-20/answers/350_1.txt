I'm unable to interpret or analyze the image as it relates to copyright criteria; however, I can guide the comparison process based on your available information:

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object appears to be a cone-shaped item with a light source or lamp on top, which doesn't align with the prompt of "a rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - The right object also resembles a lamp with a different pattern and doesn't fit the description of the prompt.
   
   Cannot decide, as neither object aligns with the original text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has consistent lighting, solid appearance, and clear design as a lamp, which seems normal.
   - The right object has a vivid pattern and appears stable as a 3D model, also normal.
   
   Cannot decide, as both are plausible as separate lamp models.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a softer, simpler texture with some details visible in the material.
   - The right object has more detailed and complex textures with colorful patterns.
   
   Right (Object 2) is better for texture detail.

Final answer:
