Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object does not clearly represent either a round stool or a rectangular sofa, appearing more like an abstract form. The right object resembles a more structured shape that could align with a rectangular sofa. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object lacks coherent 3D plausibility with random, undefined shapes. The right object has more defined, cohesive structures in appearance.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture does not align well with any plausible geometry. The right object shows better alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object's texture contains abstract, unclear details. The right object has clearer, more discernible texture details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object presents confusion in its geometry with noise. The right object shows clearer and more organized geometry details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object more accurately meets the criteria and aligns with the text prompt. 
The right one is better.
