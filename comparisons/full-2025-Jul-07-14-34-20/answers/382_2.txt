Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a spherical object with a round seat and stand, not resembling a shelf with triangular attributes.
   - The right one also shows a round seat with a stand, similarly lacking triangular elements.
   - Both do not align well with the prompt of "a triangular shelf with round edges."
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and normal with a consistent structure.
   - The right one is similarly structured with no obvious body problems or meaningless structures.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper, more defined textures in the rendering.
   - The right one has less clarity in texture detail.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
