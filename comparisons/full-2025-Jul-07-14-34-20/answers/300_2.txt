Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a rectangular shape, which doesn't fully align with the "square" aspect of the prompt.
   - The right one seems more square and aligns better with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has some exaggerated and inconsistent leg designs, making it less plausible.
   - The right one has a more solid and consistent structure, more plausible as a square coffee table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has less detailed and somewhat noisy textures.
   - The right one displays sharper and more detailed textures, giving a more realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
