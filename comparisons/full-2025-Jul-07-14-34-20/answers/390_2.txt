Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a dark finish with tapered circular legs, though it’s hard to see the ellipsoid shape clearly due to the dark color.
   - The right model appears bright with a more distinct ellipsoid tabletop and circular legs.
   - The right one is better as it corresponds more clearly to "An elliptical coffee table with circular legs."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has more noise and lacks clarity in defining the supports and table surface, giving a less solid appearance.
   - The right one shows a more uniform structure, with the table’s and legs’ shapes being more clearly defined and solid.
   - The right one is better as it appears more normal and plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a rough texture with less clarity, making it hard to discern details.
   - The right model shows a smoother, more realistic texture with clearer and more consistent detailing.
   - The right one is better in terms of texture detail.
