Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a clear rectangular shape and resembles a bookshelf with distinct shelves.
   - The right one is more abstract and less clearly defined as a bookshelf.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and plausible with consistent, recognizable shelf structures.
   - The right one has irregularities and textures that make it less plausible as a coherent 3D model.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more consistent texture that is clearer and more detailed.
   - The right one has noisier textures and appears less realistic.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
