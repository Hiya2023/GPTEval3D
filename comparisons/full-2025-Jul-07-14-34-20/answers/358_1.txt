I'm unable to evaluate the images directly, but I can guide you on how to analyze them based on your criteria. Here's how you might approach it:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left Object:** Examine if it resembles a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal.
   - **Right Object:** Check if this also looks like a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal.
   - Determine which model better represents a sphere on a cube.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left Object:** Check the solidity and natural structure. Look for any irregularities or unrealistic features.
   - **Right Object:** Do the same here, assessing for realistic and solid features.
   - Decide which one appears more stable and plausible as a 3D object.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left Object:** Focus on details, sharpness, and realism of textures.
   - **Right Object:** Notice the texture quality, sharpness, and realism here as well.
   - Choose which has a sharper and more detailed texture.

Based on the analysis you conduct:

**Final Answer Format:**

- Replace "x x x" with "1 2 2" or similar, depending on which object excels in each criterion. Use "3" sparingly if a decision truly cannot be made.
