Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has additional details not described in the prompt, while the right one is a simple spherical shape which fits the description. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more complex form, which detracts from its realism. The right object has a natural shape for a doorknob. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows mismatched textures with its shape. The right oneâ€™s textures align better with its spherical form. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has unnecessary texture details, while the right one displays smoother, more appropriate textures for a doorknob. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has noisy and inconsistent geometry, whereas the right one is smoother and well-organized. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one better represents the intended design of a spherical doorknob.
