Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows an object that doesn't resemble a stool or sofa; The right one resembles a laptop setup, neither object matches the stool and sofa description accurately. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one is an unclear flat object; The right one looks like a laptop with plausible proportions. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left's texture does not clearly match any stool or sofa; The right's texture aligns with its laptop shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left has indistinct textures; The right has clear textures representing its parts well. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left shows no meaningful structure; The right has organized geometry fitting a laptop setup. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one better represents a coherent object even though it does not match the prompt, while the left shows little coherence or relevant details. The right one is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2 2 2 2
