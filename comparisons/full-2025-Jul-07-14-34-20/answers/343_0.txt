Analysis:  
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has an elliptical shape and circular legs, matching the description well. 
   - The right model also appears elliptical and has circular legs, fitting the text prompt.  
   The left one is better because it has a more definitive elliptical shape.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks less stable, with the legs not clearly aligned perpendicularly.
   - The right model appears more solid and stable with properly aligned legs.  
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture appears fuzzy and less detailed.
   - The right model has sharper and more realistic textures.  
   The right one is better.
