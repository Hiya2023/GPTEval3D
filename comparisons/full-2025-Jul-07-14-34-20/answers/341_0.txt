I'm unable to view or analyze images directly. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on your criteria. Here's how you can approach the comparison:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - Examine whether each object resembles a stool or sofa.
   - Check if one object is rounder (stool) and the other more rectangular (sofa).
   - Determine which set of images corresponds more accurately to the description.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Analyze the images for solid, coherent structures.
   - Identify if there are any abnormalities or unrealistic features.
   - Determine which object looks more like a plausible 3D model without strange or duplicated parts.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - Look closely at the textures in the RGB images.
   - Check for sharpness, detail, and realism in the textures.
   - Decide which object has more detailed and realistic textures.

After individually evaluating each criterion, you can make a decision on whether the left (object 1) or the right (object 2) is better, or if you cannot decide.
