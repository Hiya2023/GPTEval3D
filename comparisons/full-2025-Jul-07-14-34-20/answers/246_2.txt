I'm unable to determine the details of the objects directly from images. You might want to check for cylindrical and rectangular shapes which align with the prompt description: "A cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk." 

To evaluate the objects manually, consider these points:

1. **Cylindrical Bin**: Does one of the objects have a clearly defined cylindrical shape?
2. **Rectangular Desk**: Check if there is a distinguishable rectangular shape representing the desk.
3. **Arrangement**: The two objects should be positioned beside each other.

Based on this framework, you could analyze the images to see which model captures these aspects more accurately.
