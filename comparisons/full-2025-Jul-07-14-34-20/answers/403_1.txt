Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to more closely resemble a "triangular road sign," with noticeable triangular shapes and typical road sign textures and colors.
   - The right one has a rough triangular shape but seems less aligned with typical road sign textures and details.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows more realistic forms and structures with better material representation.
   - The right one looks less solid with some distorted shapes and undefined structures.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one demonstrates sharper and more realistic textures with visible details like wood and metal surfaces.
   - The right one lacks detailed textures and appears more uniform and artificial.
   - The left one is better.
