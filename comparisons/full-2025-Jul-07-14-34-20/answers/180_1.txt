Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not resemble a cubic lamp; it seems more abstract. The right one appears rectangular but not distinctly cubic either. However, the right one better resembles a potential lamp with a solid base. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears irregular and abstract, lacking structure. The right object has a more plausible geometric form, resembling a solid object. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a dispersed texture that doesn't match its shape. The right one shows better integration between its texture and shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears abstract and unclear. The right one has clearer and more realistic textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks defined geometry and appears noisy. The right one has more organized and defined geometric details. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right object is more aligned with the prompt and has better quality in all measured aspects. The right one is better.

Final answer:
