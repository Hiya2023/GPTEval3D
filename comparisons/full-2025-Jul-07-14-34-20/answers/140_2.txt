Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a structure that does not match the prompt; the right object has a clear spherical lamp on a square nightstand. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object shows irregularities and looks less realistic; the right one is more solid and plausible with correct proportions. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: In the left object, the texture does not align with the geometry; in the right, the texture and shape align well in both the RGB and normal maps. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object lacks fine detail and appears undefined; the right object has clearer texture details. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows chaotic geometry; the right object has a more organized and detailed structure. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object effectively captures the text prompt and presents a more realistic and detailed model. The right one is better.
