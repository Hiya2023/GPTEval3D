Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left object appears to be a simple cylindrical shape, possibly resembling a basic table but lacking specific hexagonal features. The right object shows a pattern that could suggest a more complex structure but still appears cylindrical. Neither clearly represents "a hexagonal table under a round mirror." Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object is a solid shape with consistent geometry, although it is simple. The right object appears to have more complex texturing but is heavily distorted with what appear to be extraneous patterns and noise. The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left object has a smoother, more uniform texture but lacks detail. The right object has more intricate patterns and textures, even if they are noisy. The right one is better.

Final answer:
