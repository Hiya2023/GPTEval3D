Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model seems to have a more cylindrical shape with a flared top resembling a vase; the right one does not. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and aligned with a solid structure; the right one has irregular shapes. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture adheres more closely to the geometry; the right one shows mismatches. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has more defined textures; the right one appears blurry. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more organized geometry; the right one exhibits noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns better with the prompt and has greater plausibility and detail. The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
