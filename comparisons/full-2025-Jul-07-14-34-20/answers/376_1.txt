Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to have an elliptical top and circular legs, closely matching the description.
   - The right model looks more circular rather than elliptical, lacking precise alignment with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks solid and well-formed without any visible errors.
   - The right model appears less structured and coherent in some views.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has clearer and more detailed texture work.
   - The right model's textures are less sharp and realistic.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
