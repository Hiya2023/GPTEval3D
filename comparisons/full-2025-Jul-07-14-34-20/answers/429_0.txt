Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one has an undefined shape that suggests an oval tabletop but lacks detail; The right one clearly shows an oval tabletop with detailed legs that align with the "dining table" description. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks solidity due to its sketchy, incomplete rendering; The right one is more solid and plausible with a coherent structure and no obvious issues. The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has minimal texture detail; The right one exhibits sharper textures with clearer wood grain and detail. The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
