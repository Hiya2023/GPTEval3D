The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more structured and solid, representing a plausible 3D bookshelf. The right object appears fragmented and less stable.
The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left object displays more detailed and sharper textures, with distinguishable book spines. The right object lacks clear detail and realism in its textures.
The left one is better.
