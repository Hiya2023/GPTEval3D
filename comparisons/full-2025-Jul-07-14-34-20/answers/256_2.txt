I'm unable to see the images directly, but I can help analyze the given description.

Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Appears cylindrical with a clear base but does not clearly exhibit a flared top.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: More closely resembles a cylinder with a flared top section.
   
   The right one better reflects the prompt of "a cylindrical vase with a flared top."

Final answer:
2
