Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a rectangular shape with clear cylindrical armrests, matching the prompt.
   - The right model has a somewhat rectangular structure but the armrests are more blended into the sofa, not distinctly cylindrical.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more structurally coherent and normal, with clear distinct components.
   - The right model seems less defined and slightly more amorphous or blocky.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has sharper textures with visible patterns and details.
   - The right model's texture is more uniform and lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.
