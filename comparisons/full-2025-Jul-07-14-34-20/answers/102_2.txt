Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a globe on a stand; the right one is a sphere on a small pedestal. Neither resembles a cylindrical bin or a rectangular desk.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows a consistent, detailed globe with a recognizable stand; the right one appears more abstract and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with the globe's shape; the right one's texture does not match the spherical shape meaningfully.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures textures clearly, showing geographical details; the right one is less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a structured geometry reflecting a globe; the right one has less defined geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one is better on multiple fronts, except text prompt alignment.
The left one is better.
