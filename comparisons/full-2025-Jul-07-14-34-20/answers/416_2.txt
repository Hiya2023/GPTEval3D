Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a flat surface with some sort of pedestal-like structure but lacks a definitive spherical globe.
   - The right one also lacks a distinguishable spherical globe and pedestal structure.
   - Cannot decide which is better as neither represents the prompt adequately.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one seems more solid and cohesive, with a consistent structure.
   - The right one appears to have holes and inconsistencies in the structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has some texture detail but appears blurry.
   - The right one has more distinct texture, albeit with structural issues.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
