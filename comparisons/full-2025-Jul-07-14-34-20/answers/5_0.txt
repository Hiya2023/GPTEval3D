Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object does not match the text description of a "conical lampshade on a cylindrical base" as it lacks the specified shapes. The right object, while not perfect, attempts to resemble the described objects. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object is inconsistent with real-world shapes and does not appear solid. The right object, despite imperfections, is more solid and structured. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture does not align with the geometry and lacks clarity. The right object shows better alignment between texture and geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has blurred textures and lacks detail. The right object captures some fine details better. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object lacks clear geometry structure. The right object shows better organization and detail in geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object fulfills most criteria better than the left object. The right one is better.
