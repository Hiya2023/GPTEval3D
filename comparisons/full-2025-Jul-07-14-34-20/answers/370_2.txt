Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one appears to be a round object with distinct cushion-like frills, matching the descriptor "round cushion" fairly well.
   - The right one also has a round shape but lacks any detailed cushion-like features.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems solid with a logical cushion structure, though the top texture is somewhat unusual.
   - The right one is round but has a less defined, bumpy surface which may detract from its plausibility as a cushion.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one includes a more colorful and varied pattern that adds to its detail.
   - The right one has a uniform green texture with less intricate detailing.
   - The left one is better.
