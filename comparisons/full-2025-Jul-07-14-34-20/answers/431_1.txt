I'm unable to see the images directly, but I can guide you on how you could approach the analysis based on the aspects you've provided. Here's how you might evaluate them:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe the shape, colors, and any distinctive features. Determine how closely it resembles a "triangular road sign".
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Do the same as the left, focusing on elements that align with or deviate from the description.
   - Decide which one better resembles a "triangular road sign".

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Assess the solidity and structure. Look for any non-logical shapes or noisy elements.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Perform the same evaluation.
   - Decide which one appears more structurally sound and realistic.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Examine texture detail, sharpness, and realism.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Compare these same texture features.
   - Decide which model has the superior texture quality.

### Final Decision:

After completing your observations based on these criteria, summarize your decisions in the format requested, like "1 2 2" or similar, based on your individual analysis of the aspects.

By carefully considering each aspect separately, you can provide a balanced comparison of the two objects based on the given prompt.
