Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one resembles a basic cubic shape with a curved base, resembling a lamp; The right one lacks the features resembling a lamp.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more distinct cubic shape and plausible solidity; The right one has less defined and less plausible structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows a more cohesive alignment between texture and geometry; The right one has misaligned textures and shapes.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one maintains finer texture details without excessive abstraction; The right one appears less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows more organized geometry with less noise; The right one has unclear geometric details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one captures the text prompt better and presents a more plausible and detailed model.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
