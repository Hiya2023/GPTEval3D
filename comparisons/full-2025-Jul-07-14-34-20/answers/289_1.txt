Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left object (1): Shows a flat, circular rug, accurately capturing the description based on the overall shape and texture visible in the renderings and normals.
   - The right object (2): Appears spherical rather than flat, which does not align with the concept of a rug as described. The normal renderings support this observation, showing a more three-dimensional form.

The left one is better as it accurately represents a "circular rug."

Final answer:
