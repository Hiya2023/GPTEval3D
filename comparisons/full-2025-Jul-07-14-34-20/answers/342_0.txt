Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a green sphere with a textured surface but lacks a triangular traffic cone representation.
   - The right object resembles a golden sphere placed on a flat base, without a visible triangular traffic cone.
   - Neither object fully covers the text prompt of "a triangular traffic cone beside a circular ball."
   
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object's sphere-like form is consistent, but its overall structure seems amorphous and lacks solid definition.
   - The right object is more solid and structured, particularly the sphere, and looks more plausible as a 3D model.
   
   Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a highly textured surface but lacks detail clarity.
   - The right object has sharper, more realistic textures, particularly on the sphere, with more defined details.
   
   Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
