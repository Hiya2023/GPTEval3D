Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a smooth hexagonal shape that aligns with the text prompt "A hexagonal mirror."
   - The right one appears more like a diamond shape and includes elements that are not specified in the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears coherent as a solid object with a consistent normal structure, lacking apparent anomalies.
   - The right one has extra details that do not contribute to its plausibility as a hexagonal mirror.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a blurred texture with less detail.
   - The right one, despite its deviation from the hexagonal shape, showcases more sharpness and detail.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
