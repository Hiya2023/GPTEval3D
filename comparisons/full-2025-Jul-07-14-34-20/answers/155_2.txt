Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one corresponds well to a "cylindrical vase" as it shows a smooth, cylinder-like shape; The right one does not appear cylindrical and deviates significantly from the vase description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one appears more natural and believable as a vase with proper proportions; The right one has irregular and unrealistic structures.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one shows a consistency between texture and shape; The right one shows a mismatch between the geometry and the texture.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one has clearer, more consistent textures that suit a vase; The right one appears noisy and less defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one's geometry is smooth and coherent; The right one has irregular and distorted geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one aligns well with the prompt, is plausible, and has better texture and geometry.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
