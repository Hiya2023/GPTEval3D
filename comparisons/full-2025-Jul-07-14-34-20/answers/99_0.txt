Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object resembles a geometric shape not conforming to a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base.
   - The right object also lacks a conical lampshade but maintains a somewhat distinct base.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears fragmented and lacks cohesive structure.
   - The right object appears slightly more structured but still irregular.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object's texture does not align well with its geometry.
   - The right object has a slight improvement in texture alignment.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object lacks texture details and appears blurry.
   - The right object has better texture detail than the left.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows poor geometry detail.
   - The right object exhibits slightly better geometry detail.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right object aligns better in terms of texture and geometry details.
   - Right (object 2) is better.
