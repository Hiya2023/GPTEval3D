Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a rougher texture which doesn't resemble a typical cubic ottoman; the right one has a cleaner representation with clearer ottoman features. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears irregular and less structured; the right one has a more solid and natural ottoman shape. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture does not correspond well with geometry; the right one's texture aligns better with the geometry, enhancing the cubic aspect. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is more chaotic and unclear; the right one is clearer with finer details that match the intended design. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks clear cubic definition; the right one has more defined edges and coherent geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one provides a clearer and more accurate representation of a cubic ottoman. The right one is better.
