Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has vertical and rectangular proportions with multiple shelves and objects on it, fitting the description of a bookshelf.
   - The right one also has a rectangular shape but appears less filled and solid compared to the left one.
   - The left one is better aligned with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and consistent, without visible structural issues.
   - The right one seems less stable and lacks the solidity expected in a bookshelf.
   - The left one is more plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one presents a sharper and more detailed texture, especially with the visible books on the shelves.
   - The right one has less detailed and less realistic textures.
   - The left one is better in terms of texture.
