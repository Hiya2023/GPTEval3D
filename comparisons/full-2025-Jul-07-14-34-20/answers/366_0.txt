Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a couch with a textured surface.
   - The right one also resembles a couch with a more defined structure.
   - Neither resembles a spherical lamp on a square nightstand.
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is somewhat plausible as a solid structure but does not represent a lamp or nightstand.
   - The right one is more coherent in structure but still not representative of the prompt.
   Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a rough, unclear texture.
   - The right one shows slightly more detailed texturing.
   Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 3 2
