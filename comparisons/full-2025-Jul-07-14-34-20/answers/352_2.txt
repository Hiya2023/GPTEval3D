   - The left one has a more complex shape which deviates from a simple cylindrical form. 
   - The right one is a straightforward cylindrical vase.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has an irregular structure with unpredictable protrusions.
   - The right one appears more stable and solid as a cylinder.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more detailed textures with noticeable patterns and colors.
