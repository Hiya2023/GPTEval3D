Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model includes additional elements not mentioned in the text, such as plants and objects on shelves. The right model more accurately reflects a "rectangular bookshelf." 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has irregular shapes and protrusions that make it look less plausible. The right model has a more solid and realistic bookshelf structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows misalignment with textures not matching the geometry well. The right model's texture adheres well to its geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures seem noisy and less detailed. The right model has clearer and more realistic textures resembling wood.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model appears disorganized and noisy. The right model has a cleaner and more defined geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right model better fulfills the criteria.
The right one is better.
