I'm unable to provide a direct analysis of images. However, I can offer guidance on how to approach analyzing the 3D objects.

**Guidelines for Analysis:**

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**:
   - **Shape**: Ensure that one object is round (stool) and the other is rectangular (sofa).
   - **Position**: The round stool should be visually discernible beside the rectangular sofa.
   - **Attributes**: Check for other attributes such as size proportions and overall composition as described.

2. **Decision Criteria**:
   - Determine which side better aligns with the description of one round object beside a rectangular object.

If you provide detailed insights into what you observe in each object, I can help guide you to make a decision based on those observations.
