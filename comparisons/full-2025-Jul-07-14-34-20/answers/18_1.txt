Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more cylindrical shape; the right one appears slightly more rounded. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has consistent proportions and a stable look; the right one has more irregularities.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one aligns well between RGB and normal maps; the right one shows slight mismatches.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The textures on the left are clearer and well-defined; the right appears more blurred.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows smoother and finer geometric details; the right is less defined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object consistently meets all criteria more effectively.
The left one is better.
