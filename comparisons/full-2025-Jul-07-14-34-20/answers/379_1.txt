Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be two separate objects that do not correspond to the "spherical globe on a cubic pedestal" description.
   - The right one, while not perfect, has a more structured appearance that vaguely suggests a base and potentially a round shape on top.
   
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks coherence and solidity; it appears to have fragmented or irregular structures.
   - The right one appears more solid and coherent as a unified structure, despite its colorful texture.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has some texture but lacks detail and sharpness.
   - The right one displays a more detailed texture with distinct colors and patterns.
   
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
