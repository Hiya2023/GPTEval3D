Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more like a hexagonal shape; the right one has a clearly visible hexagonal shape but lacks a triangular frame.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more solid appearance but uncertain shape; the right one shows a clear hexagonal shape but less solidity.
   Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has some mismatch between geometry and texture; the right one aligns better, showing the hexagonal shape clearly in both RGB and normal maps.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more blurring; the right one shows clearer texture details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows less precision in geometry details; the right one has more accurate geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better captures the described hexagonal mirror, despite some alignment issues with the triangular frame.
   The right one is better.
