Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears as a rectangular bookshelf with multiple shelves, filled with books on some shelves, aligning well with the text description.
   - The right model also represents a bookshelf but is less traditional in form, with a more open and non-rectangular shape.
   - The left one is better at aligning with the prompt of a "rectangular bookshelf."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has a more structured and solid appearance resembling a traditional bookshelf without any apparent structural issues.
   - The right model appears less stable and a bit abstract, which could imply potential noise or strange parts.
   - The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows distinct textures with visible details, especially with the books filling the shelves.
   - The right model has less sharpness and detail in its texture mapping.
   - The left one is better in terms of low-level texture quality.
