Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has an irregular shape and doesn't clearly represent a mirror with a triangular frame.
   - The right one depicts a hexagonal shape with a clear border, more closely aligned with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears less structured and somewhat abstract, with a lack of clear edges.
   - The right one is solid and structured, with clearly defined edges, making it more plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a rough texture without distinct details.
   - The right one has a sharper, more realistic appearance, with clearer texture on the surface.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
