Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more pronounced oval shape and distinctive leg structure fitting the "oval dining table" description.
   - The right one is also oval and has table legs, but its shape might be less clearly defined. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one shows an appropriate, solid structure with more detailed leg design.
   - The right one has plausible structure but looks simpler and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one exhibits well-aligned textures that follow the shape of the table.
   - The right one's alignment is less clear with potential mismatches.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has clear textures with wood-like patterns.
   - The right one appears less detailed and slightly blurry.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has intricate leg details and smooth geometry.
   - The right one has simpler geometry with less defined details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, 
   The left one better captures the "oval dining table" prompt with superior detail and texture. 
   The left one is better.
