Analysis:
1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object resembles a cuboid with visible legs, slightly aligning with a "cubic ottoman" but appears elongated. The right object is more cubic and compact, closely matching the description. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more structured and solid, whereas the right one, although closer to the cube shape, has minor irregularities. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left objectâ€™s texture aligns better with its geometry, while the right object shows misalignment between its texture and shape. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object displays more detailed and varied textures, while the right one is less defined. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has more intricate geometry details, as seen in the normal maps, compared to the right one. 
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the alignment with the prompt alongside structural and textural aspects, the left object is more plausible and detailed overall, while the right one aligns better with the prompt shape.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
