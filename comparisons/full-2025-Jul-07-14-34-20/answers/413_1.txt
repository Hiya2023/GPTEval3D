Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: Appears to be a wooden table with an uneven texture, but its overall shape is not clearly square and seems slightly distorted.
   - The right one: Has a more structured design with a clear square shape, matching the text prompt more effectively.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Looks slightly distorted with possibly inconsistent geometry in the renderings.
   - The right one: Appears more stable and realistic, with a coherent structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Texture appears rough and lacks clarity, with less detail.
   - The right one: Texture seems sharper and more defined, showing a wooden pattern more distinctly.
   - The right one is better.
