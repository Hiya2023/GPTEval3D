Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a more pronounced conical top compared to a cylindrical base, which better matches the "conical lampshade on a cylindrical base" description. The right model doesn't clearly display these attributes. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more coherent and stable with sensible proportions. The right one has irregularities in shape. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left model align well with its geometry, maintaining the cone and cylinder distinction. The right model's textures do not match its geometry as effectively. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clearer and more detailed textures without blurring. The right model appears less detailed. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more refined and organized geometry details. The right model contains more noise and less coherent details. The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all factors, the left model aligns better with the text prompt, has better 3D plausibility, and superior texture and geometry details. The left one is better.
