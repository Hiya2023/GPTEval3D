Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to show a roughly spherical green object with no clear triangular traffic cone feature.
   - The right object looks like a gold spherical ball on a round base, but lacks a clear triangular traffic cone.
   The right one is better in aligning with the "circular ball" part of the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems abstract with no solid shape or clear structure.
   - The right object appears more solid and plausible as a spherical object.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a rough, unclear texture.
   - The right object has a smoother, more uniform texture.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
