Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a square shape but has slightly irregular edges.
   - The right one maintains a more consistent square shape but includes additional non-coherent elements.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and more table-like in shape and proportion.
   - The right one exhibits distortions and appears less realistic.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows better alignment between texture and geometry.
   - The right one has texture misalignment, adding irregular patterns not matching the geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures wood texture effectively and consistently.
   - The right one exhibits noisy elements disrupting the texture's natural look.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has smoother geometry with fewer inconsistencies.
   - The right one shows messy, noisy geometry that obscures the shape.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Across all criteria, the left one consistently performs better by accurately portraying a square coffee table.
   - The left one is better.
