Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The object is a diamond shape, not triangular, which doesn't match the description of a "triangular road sign." The colors are vibrant, but the shape is incorrect.
   - Right (object 2): The object appears to resemble a triangle more closely, aligning better with the prompt of a "triangular road sign." The color and pole add to its realistic representation.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
