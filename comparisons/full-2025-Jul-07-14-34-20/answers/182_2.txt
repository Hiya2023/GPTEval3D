Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a more abstract form and texture that doesn't clearly convey a "square coffee table."
   - The right object closely resembles a traditional square coffee table in form and texture.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears less natural due to irregular shapes and proportions.
   - The right object presents a natural and plausible structure with consistent proportions.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture and geometry do not align well, with the texture appearing abstract.
   - The right object shows a strong alignment between texture and geometry, resembling a coffee table.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has a blurry and undefined texture.
   - The right object exhibits fine texture details suitable for a coffee table.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object lacks clarity and detail in its geometry.
   - The right object presents organized geometry, clear shapes, and pleasing details.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria:
   The right one consistently performs better across all evaluation aspects.
   The right one is better.
