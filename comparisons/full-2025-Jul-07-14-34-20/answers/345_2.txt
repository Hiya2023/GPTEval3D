Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - The left object appears to be a chair, which does not align with the text prompt "A triangular shelf with round edges."
   - The right object seems to have more abstract features, but it also does not clearly resemble a triangular shelf with round edges.
   - Cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left object looks solid and resembles a plausible chair model with consistent structure.
   - The right object has a more abstract, less cohesive structure, with sections that appear to lack clear solidity.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left object's texture appears more defined, with visible differentiation in the seat area.
   - The right object has a more noisy and less defined texture.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
