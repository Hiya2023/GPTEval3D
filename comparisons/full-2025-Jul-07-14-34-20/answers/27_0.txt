Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a detailed floral texture, not fully aligned with the simple "round cushion" prompt; The right one shows a round shape with a pattern that could suggest a cushion. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has irregular shapes with protrusions; The right one presents a more plausible, round cushion shape without abnormalities.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a misalignment between the complex texture and irregular geometry; The right one shows coherent texture with its geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has detailed textures; The right one has simpler but clearer textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows irregularities and noise; The right one has a smooth surface representing a cushion.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one captures a round cushion better with accurate shape, texture alignment, and plausible details.
The right one is better.
