Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

   - The left object (Object 1) appears to have a cuboid bookshelf shape, potentially with shelves visible in the renderings. However, there is no visible circular clock above it.
   
   - The right object (Object 2) does not resemble a cuboid bookshelf and lacks a clear indication of a circular clock above it. Its shape is more angular and irregular.

The left one (Object 1) is better as it resembles a cuboid bookshelf more closely, aligning somewhat with the text prompt, despite the absence of a clock.

Final answer:
