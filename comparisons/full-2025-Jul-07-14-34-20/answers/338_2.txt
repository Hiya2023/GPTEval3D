Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to have an irregular structure with several disjointed parts, not resembling a shelf. It lacks the characteristic triangular shape and rounded edges.
   - The right model looks more like a piece of furniture with a rounded shape, though it doesn’t distinctly resemble a triangular shelf with round edges.
   
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model seems fragmented and less coherent, possessing strange structures that don’t appear solid or normal.
   - The right model, meanwhile, presents a more plausible and solid structure resembling a coherent furniture piece.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model’s texture appears chaotic without clear details.
   - The right model displays sharper and more detailed textures, suggesting a better low-level texture quality.
   
   The right one is better.
