Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is not cylindrical and lacks a flared top, deviating from the text prompt.
   - The right model is also not cylindrical and does not have a flared top.
   
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears to have a more consistent shape, albeit not fitting the description.
   - The right model looks solid, but also doesn't fit the description well.
   
   Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture has some sharpness and details.
   - The right model also has a reasonable texture but appears slightly more washed out.
   
   Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
