Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more deformed and less cushion-like, while the right one has a more accurate round cushion shape.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks natural cushion features and appears irregular, while the right one is more solid and cushion-like.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has poor texture alignment with a misshaped geometry, while the right one's texture aligns well with its geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has vague textures that don't represent a cushion, while the right one has more detailed and cushion-like textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays chaotic structures, whereas the right one shows organized and smooth surface details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better represents a round cushion with accurate proportions and details.
The right one is better.
