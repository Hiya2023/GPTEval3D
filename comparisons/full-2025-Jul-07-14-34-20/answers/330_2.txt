I'm unable to evaluate the object descriptions in the images, but I can help guide you in how to perform the analysis based on the given text prompt: "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - Describe Object 1: Look for rectangular and oval shapes or features that resemble a sofa and a mirror.
   - Describe Object 2: Do the same as above.
   - Determine which object aligns better with the prompt based on these features.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Object 1: Look for solid, cohesive shapes without strange distortions or duplications.
   - Object 2: Assess similarly and determine which is more structurally sound and plausible as a 3D model.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - Object 1: Evaluate sharpness, detail, and realism of textures.
   - Object 2: Compare similarly and determine which has better textural quality.

### Final Answer:
Based on your detailed comparison, choose the best option using:
- Left (object 1) is better.
- Right (object 2) is better.
- Cannot decide (use sparingly).
