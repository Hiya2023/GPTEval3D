Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one includes additional elements like plants and books, deviating from a simple "rectangular bookshelf."
   - The right one aligns more closely with the description of just a "rectangular bookshelf."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows irregularities, with extra elements and varied proportions.
   - The right one looks more coherent and plausible as a solid bookshelf.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has inconsistent texture alignment due to extraneous objects.
   - The right one showcases good alignment between its simple bookshelf structure and texture.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one presents textures that are somewhat chaotic due to additional objects.
   - The right one shows clearer, more coherent textures appropriate for wood detailing.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one appears noisy with unnecessary complexity.
   - The right one has a more refined and organized structure, suitable for a bookshelf.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one consistently adheres to the text prompt and displays better structural logic and coherence.
   - The right one is better.
