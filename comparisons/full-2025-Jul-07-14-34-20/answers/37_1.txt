Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has additional features that aren't aligned with the prompt of a "spherical doorknob." The right one is more consistent with the prompt.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has an irregular structure, while the right one appears more as a plausible spherical shape.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures and shape are inconsistent; the right model aligns better in terms of geometric and textural consistency.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more visual noise while the right one maintains clarity.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows unnecessary complexity; the right one is smoother and more organized.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better represents a spherical doorknob with consistent geometry, texture, and details.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
