Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object matches the "rectangular bookshelf" prompt more accurately with clear horizontal shelves and vertical supports. The right object has an irregular shape and doesn't clearly resemble a bookshelf.  
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears stable and plausible with symmetrical shelves, while the right object has irregular shapes and seems less structurally sound.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left object align well with the structure of the bookshelf. The right object's texture is more chaotic and doesn't match the structure as well.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clearer, more defined textures suitable for a bookshelf. The right objectâ€™s textures seem noisy and less focused.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows well-defined structure without extraneous noise. The right object includes irregularities and lacks coherent detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object provides a more accurate and stable representation of a "rectangular bookshelf," with better texture and geometry alignment.
The left one is better.
