Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model clearly shows a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests, aligning with the text description. The right model lacks distinct cylindrical armrests and a clear rectangular shape. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks solid and natural with proper sofa proportions. The right one appears abstract and less structured. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with the geometry, maintaining consistent shapes. The right model shows misalignment and unusual structures. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine textures in a clear and detailed manner. The right model's textures are less defined and somewhat blurred. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents organized and intricate geometry that is visually pleasing. The right model lacks detailed organization and has noise. 
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model better adheres to the text description, with superior structure, texture, and detail.
The left one is better.
