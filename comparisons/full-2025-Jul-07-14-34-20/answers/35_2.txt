Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a circular seat but no clear square base; the right one shows a clear square base and circular seat.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks natural proportions; the right one appears plausible as a simple stool.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has misaligned textures; the right one has textures that align consistently.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left oneâ€™s textures are blurry and abstract; the right one has clear textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has inconsistent details; the right one has smooth, clear geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one fits the prompt and is visually coherent.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
