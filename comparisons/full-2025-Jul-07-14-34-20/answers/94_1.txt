Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: The left model has intricate details and does not fully align with the prompt of "a spherical doorknob." The right one is a smooth, spherical shape which aligns more closely with the description.
   The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: The left model's intricate details could imply complexity but also lead to unnatural features for a doorknob. The right model appears more natural and consistent with typical doorknob proportions.
   The right one is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: The left object shows detailed texture but not aligning well with its form. The right object's texture aligns better with its spherical geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: The left model has more intricate texture details, but they do not suit a spherical doorknob. The right model has more appropriate texture detailing for the given prompt.
   The right one is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: The left model showcases complex geometry details but is irrelevant to the intended shape. The right model maintains a simple geometry consistent with a spherical doorknob.
   The right one is better.

6. **Overall**: The right model aligns closely with the prompt, is more plausible, and has a well-suited texture and geometry for a spherical doorknob.
   The right one is better.
