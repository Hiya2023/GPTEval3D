Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left: Appears to reflect a rectangular shape with cylindrical armrests more accurately.
   - Right: Displays a more abstract shape that doesn't clearly resemble a sofa.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: Appears solid and natural with plausible proportions and structure.
   - Right: Looks irregular and chaotic, with unfamiliar shapes and structures.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - Left: Geometry and texture seem well-aligned, maintaining the sofa's shape.
   - Right: Texture does not match well with geometry, creating a distorted appearance.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - Left: Texture is subtle and fairly detailed, fitting the expected appearance of a sofa.
   - Right: Texture is abstract and lacks clarity.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - Left: Geometry is organized and smooth, defining the sofa appropriately.
   - Right: Geometry is noisy and lacks coherent structure.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model consistently captures the intended structure and texture of a sofa more effectively.
   - The left one is better.
