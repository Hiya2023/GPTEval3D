Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a square top but the legs appear slanted and not aligned neatly at the edges, which may deviate from a typical coffee table design.
   - The right model has a square top with more conventional, straight legs, making it align better with the text description of "A square coffee table."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model displays strange leg alignment and overall structure that may not seem stable or plausible.
   - The right model shows a more solid and structurally plausible design with better-aligned legs and a realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model's texture appears more detailed and sharper, with visible wood grain and reflective variations.
   - The right model, while visibly smoother, lacks the depth of texture detail present in the left model.
   - The left one is better.
