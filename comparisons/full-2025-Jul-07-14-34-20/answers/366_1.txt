Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a couch or sofa structure with cushions, which doesn't align with the prompt of "A spherical lamp on a square nightstand."
   - The right one also resembles a couch with legs but lacks the elements of a spherical lamp and a square nightstand.
   - Cannot decide which one aligns better as neither matches the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and structured, resembling a clear, singular piece of furniture.
   - The right one shows more irregularities and appears fragmented, which makes it less plausible as a coherent model.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more defined textures with sharper and more distinguishable cushions.
   - The right one lacks detail and appears more blurred.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
