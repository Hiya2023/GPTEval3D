I'm unable to view the images directly or provide detailed analyses based on their content. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on your criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left Object:**
     - Describe the model's shape, features, and any notable characteristics.
     - Assess how well these match the text prompt "A spherical doorknob."
   - **Right Object:**
     - Describe the model similarly.
     - Evaluate its alignment with the text prompt.

   Decide which model aligns better with the description of a spherical doorknob.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left Object:**
     - Visualize the 3D shape from the RGB and normal images.
     - Identify any strange or incorrect structures.
   - **Right Object:**
     - Perform a similar assessment.

   Choose the more plausible, solid, and cohesive model.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left Object:**
     - Focus on the sharpness and detail of textures in the RGB images.
   - **Right Object:**
     - Evaluate similarly for texture detail and realism.

   Determine which model has superior texture quality.

### Final Decision:

Summarize your analysis in the format:

`<option for criterion 1> <option for criterion 2> <option for criterion 3>`

For example, "1 2 2" means:
- Left is better for Text prompt & 3D Alignment.
- Right is better for 3D Plausibility and Low-Level Texture.

Apply this process to your images for an informed decision!
