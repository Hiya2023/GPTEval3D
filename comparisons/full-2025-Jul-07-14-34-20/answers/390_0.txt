Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears elliptical with circular legs, matching the description fairly well.
   - The right one also seems to fulfill the elliptical shape and circular leg features.
   - Cannot decide which aligns better as both seem to match the prompt similarly.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid, but there might be some unevenness in the structure.
   - The right one appears more consistent and solid without noticeable irregularities.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a rough texture with less detail.
   - The right one shows a more realistic and detailed texture.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
