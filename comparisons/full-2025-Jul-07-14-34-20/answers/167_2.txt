Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features intricate details and does not resemble a spherical doorknob; the right one is simple and spherical. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has complex features that do not enhance realism; the right one appears more natural and solid as a simple doorknob shape. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture and geometry do not align well; the right one's texture suits its simple spherical geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has detailed textures but lacks relevance; the right one maintains clarity and appropriateness. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry is overly complex; the right one captures a spherical form effectively. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model consistently represents the given prompt more effectively in simplicity and accuracy. The right one is better.
