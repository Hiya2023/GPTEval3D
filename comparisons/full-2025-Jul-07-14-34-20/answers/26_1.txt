I'm unable to view or directly compare images, but I can guide you on how to approach the comparison based on the evaluation criteria:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - The left model: Analyze how well it captures a "cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk." Check for the presence of these elements and their attributes.
   - The right model: Similarly, verify the presence and accuracy of the cylindrical bin and rectangular desk.
   - **Decision:** Choose the one that better represents the described scene.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - The left model: Consider if it looks natural and solid. Check for odd proportions or unrealistic features.
   - The right model: Do the same assessment regarding realism and structure.
   - **Decision:** Select the one that appears more plausible as a 3D model.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - The left model: Ensure that the textures align well with the shapes in both RGB and normal maps.
   - The right model: Evaluate the texture and geometry alignment similarly.
   - **Decision:** Opt for the model with better alignment.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - The left model: Look for fine, clear details in textures without blurriness.
   - The right model: Check the texture details for clarity and aesthetic.
   - **Decision:** Determine which model captures finer texture details effectively.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - The left model: Analyze the normal maps for detailed and organized geometry.
   - The right model: Compare the geometry details with the left model's.
   - **Decision:** Decide based on the presence of well-defined geometry details.

6. **Overall:**
   - Combine all criteria to determine which model is superior overall.

### Final Answer Format:

Use this format to provide your final answer based on your analyses:
"1 2 2 3 2 1" or similar, where each number corresponds to which model was better for each criterion.
