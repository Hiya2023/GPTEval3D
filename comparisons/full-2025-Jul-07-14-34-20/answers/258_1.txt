Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) shows an object with a spherical shape on a pedestal, possibly resembling a lamp or decorative item. It does not depict a triangular traffic cone or a round ball directly.
   - The right one (object 2) clearly shows a spherical object, which can be interpreted as a ball, but also lacks the depiction of a triangular traffic cone.

Neither model displays both a triangular traffic cone and a circular ball as described in the text prompt.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
