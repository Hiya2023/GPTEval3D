Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model closely aligns with the description of a "square coffee table" due to its simple, square shape and table-like appearance. The right model includes ornate legs, which might not match the simplicity implied by the prompt. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more stable and solid, reflecting realistic proportions and a plausible structure for a coffee table. The right model's intricate legs might seem less stable. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns with its flat, square shape, while the right model's texture seems more misaligned due to complex textures on ornate shapes. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has a uniform texture that suits a simplistic table aesthetic. The right model's details are more complex but less consistent with the prompt. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits a smooth, coherent geometry appropriate for a simple table. The right model has added geometry that doesn't match the intended simplicity.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model adheres more closely to the text prompt, maintains a realistic structure, and has more aligned geometry and texture.
The left one is better.
