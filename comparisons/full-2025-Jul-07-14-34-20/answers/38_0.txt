Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a road sign but not clearly triangular; the right object is distinctly triangular and more aligned with the prompt. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has an irregular shape with text that seems out of place; the right object appears more natural and solid.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object has some disjointed text elements; the right object's texture is well-aligned with its triangular geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has unclear and noisy textures; the right object has clearer and more defined textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object presents with uneven geometry and noise; the right object displays more organized and smooth geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object more accurately reflects the text prompt and maintains structural integrity across evaluations.
The right one is better.
