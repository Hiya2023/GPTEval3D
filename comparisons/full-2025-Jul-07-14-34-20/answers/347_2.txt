Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple, round, and uniformly colored cushion, which aligns well with the prompt "A round cushion."
   - The right one has a colorful, floral pattern and additional elements that don't directly align with a typical "round cushion" description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and plausible with a consistent rounded shape.
   - The right one has some extraneous elements and less cohesive structure, making it less plausible as a singular, solid cushion.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows a uniform texture with less detail.
   - The right one has a detailed, intricate design with sharper, more realistic texturing.
   - The right one is better.
