Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a straightforward rectangular bookshelf with visible shelves and an overall simple rectangular shape.
   - The right one has an irregular structure with additional visual noise and doesn't clearly resemble a bookshelf.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and plausible as a bookshelf, with clear shelves and a consistent structure.
   - The right one has irregularities, looking distorted and less structurally sound with strange elements.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a clearer and more defined texture, resembling wood grain.
   - The right one has noisy textures and less defined details.
   - The left one is better.
