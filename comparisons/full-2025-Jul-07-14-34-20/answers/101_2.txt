Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has triangular edges but lacks hexagonal surfaces; The right one has a better hexagonal shape with triangular framing elements. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less stable, with uneven structures; The right one seems more solid and symmetrical. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left and right both have some alignment issues, but the right one better matches geometry and texture. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is blurry in some parts; the right one captures more distinct details in texture. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has less defined geometry; the right one has more intricate shapes and smooth integration. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all factors, the right one shows more accuracy and quality. The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
