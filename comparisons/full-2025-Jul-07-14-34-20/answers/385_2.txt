Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a cylindrical object with a more distinct base and top, without clear hexagonal or round features.
   - The right one is also cylindrical and lacks distinct hexagonal or round mirror features.
   - Neither model clearly represents a "hexagonal table under a round mirror."
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more solid with distinct edges and a consistent structure.
   - The right one appears blurry with less defined boundaries and is less coherent.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows sharper textures with clearer colors and edges.
   - The right one is more blurred and lacks detailed texturing.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
