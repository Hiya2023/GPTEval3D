Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model: The object appears elliptical, with legs that follow the circular description.
   - The right model: Also seems elliptical and has the circular legs specified.
   - Cannot decide. Both models align well with the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model: Appears consistent and solid, without strange distortions.
   - The right model: Also maintains a solid structure with plausible geometry.
   - Cannot decide. Both models are equally plausible in 3D.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model: Textures appear somewhat blurry and lack sharpness.
   - The right model: Textures are clearer with more visible details.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
