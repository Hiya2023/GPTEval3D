Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to resemble a soft, cushion-like object, not aligning with the prompt for a "spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - The right one has a more defined cubic and spherical shape, showing a better interpretation of a globe on a pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks less structured and more amorphous, lacking the stability of a plausible 3D model.
   - The right one appears more solid and structurally sound, aligning better with the notion of a distinct globe and pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has smoother textures but lacks detail and sharpness.
   - The right one's textures are more vivid and detailed, with distinct patterns.
   - The right one is better.
