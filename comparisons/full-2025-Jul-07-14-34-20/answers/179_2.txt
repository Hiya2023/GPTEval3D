Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clearer cubic shape with a curved base; the right one is less defined in shape and doesn't clearly depict the cubic form.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and plausible with a distinct cubic and curved base form; the right one is less natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows a more consistent alignment between geometry and texture; the right one has more discrepancies.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clearer and more detailed textures; the right one appears blurrier.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows better-defined geometry and smooth surfaces; the right one is less organized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left object more accurately reflects the prompt and exhibits better technical qualities.
The left one is better.


Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
