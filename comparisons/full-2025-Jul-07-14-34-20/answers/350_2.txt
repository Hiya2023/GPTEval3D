I'm unable to identify or analyze the visual details of the image, such as objects, textures, or alignments. However, I can provide a possible approach on how to conduct such an evaluation based on the aspects mentioned.

### Example Analysis Approach:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - Describe each model by comparing visible shapes with the text prompt description "A rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror." Check if there are any rectangular and oval shapes in the models.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Evaluate if the models appear to have a coherent and solid 3D structure. Check for any structural deformities or mismatches like overlapping parts or missing pieces.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - Focus on the details within the texture, such as surface definition, clarity, and realistic representation. Look for details like sharpness and how well-defined the surfaces appear.

### Reminder:

While performing the evaluation, focus on each criterion separately and provide your conclusions based on the directions given, such as choosing which model performs better in each aspect.

After reviewing the images and reaching those conclusions, consolidate your findings into the specified format.
