Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object appears to resemble a square coffee table, but the surface seems uneven and the design is more intricate.
   - The right object also resembles a square coffee table, with a more consistent square shape and traditional design.
   - The right one is better in keeping with the "square coffee table" prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has some irregularities in its shape and surface, which might affect its solidity.
   - The right object looks more solid and consistent as a coffee table, without any major strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right one is better in 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object shows more texture and detail in the wood grain and surface.
   - The right object's texture is less detailed and appears darker.
   - The left one is better in low-level texture.
