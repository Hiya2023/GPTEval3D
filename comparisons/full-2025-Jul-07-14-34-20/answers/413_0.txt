I'm unable to view the images directly to make a comparison. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the criteria provided.

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - **Describe each model**: Check if each model resembles a square coffee table. Look for attributes like a square top and appropriate height.
   - **Evaluate alignment**: Determine which model aligns better with the concept of a "square coffee table."

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - Look at the structure and form in both RGB and normal renderings. 
   - Check for any abnormalities, duplicated parts, or nonsensical structures. Decide which appears more realistic and plausible as a 3D object.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - Examine texture details closely in the RGB images.
   - Choose which model has sharper, more realistic textures with richer details.

Once you evaluate based on these criteria, summarize your findings with the decision options.

Example based on hypothetical evaluation:

"
Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one looks more like a square coffee table; The right one is also quite aligned but slightly less so.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has some strange structures; The right one looks more solid and plausible.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one's texture is slightly blurry; The right one has sharper and more detailed textures.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
1 2 2
