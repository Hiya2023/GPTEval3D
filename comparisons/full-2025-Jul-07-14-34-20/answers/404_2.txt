Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a simple, square table with a flat top and four legs. It aligns well with the prompt "A square coffee table."
   - The right model is a more decorative table with ornate legs and a textured surface. While it is also square, the additional features might deviate slightly from the simplicity suggested by the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model is straightforward and plausible as a table, with a basic structure and no apparent issues.
   - The right model, while more complex, also appears generally sound and coherent, though the exaggerated features might affect its perception as a typical coffee table.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a basic texture that lacks detail but is consistent.
   - The right model has a textured surface with more intricate detailing, making it visually richer and more realistic.
   - The right one is better.
