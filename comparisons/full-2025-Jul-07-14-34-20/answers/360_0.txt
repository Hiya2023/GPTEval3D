Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one appears to be a cylindrical shape, not matching the description of a hexagonal table under a round mirror. The right one more closely resembles a table with rounded and hexagonal aspects, fitting the description better.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks like a simple cylinder, which might be solid, but lacks other defining features. The right one has a more complex structure that is consistent with a table, making it more plausible as a 3D model.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has very basic texture with little detail. The right one, despite low resolution, exhibits more color variance and detail akin to wood grain and metallic elements.
The right one is better.
