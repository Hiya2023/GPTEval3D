Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object is clearly an oval table with visible legs and an ornate design.
   - The right object is also an oval table with a distinct surface and leg structure.
   - Both models correspond well to the description of "an oval dining table."
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears structurally plausible with a coherent table shape and leg arrangement.
   - The right object also looks normal and solid with a realistic table form.
   - Both seem plausible without strange anomalies or noisy structures.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object shows a detailed wood texture with intricate surface details.
   - The right object also has a realistic wood appearance, but the texture seems relatively darker.
   - The left object is sharper and more detailed.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
