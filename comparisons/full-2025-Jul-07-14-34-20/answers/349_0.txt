Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a simple square shape, consistent with a basic coffee table design.
   - The right model also reflects a square coffee table, but with more ornate details.
   The decision depends on preference for simplicity or detail, but both align well with the prompt.
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid and lacks any visible anomalies or strange structures.
   - The right model has more detailed legs but might have slightly uneven surfaces.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture appears less detailed and somewhat blurry.
   - The right model showcases sharper and more intricate textures, especially on the table surface.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
