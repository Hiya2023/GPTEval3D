Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model clearly represents a triangular road sign, matching the text prompt well. The right model features a rectangular road sign, which deviates from the prompt. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has consistent proportions for a triangular sign, while the right one has an unsuitable shape for the prompt. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model’s geometry and texture align correctly, forming a recognizable triangular shape. The right model's texture and geometry mismatch, as it's not triangular. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model exhibits more detailed textures that closely resemble a typical triangular road sign. The right model is less detailed and not suitable for the prompt's sign type. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more detail in the normal maps, with a clear triangular shape. The right model’s details do not match well with the expected triangular geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one maintains consistent alignment with the prompt across all criteria, effectively capturing the essence of a "triangular road sign."

The left one is better.
