Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a somewhat rectangular shape but lacks clear cylindrical armrests.
   - The right one has a more defined rectangular shape and suggests the presence of cylindrical armrests.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid but has an unrealistic, organic-like texture that distorts the shape.
   - The right one seems smoother and more conventional for a sofa, enhancing the plausibility.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a rough, noisy texture that is not sharp.
   - The right one has a smoother texture with more realistic blending and shading.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
