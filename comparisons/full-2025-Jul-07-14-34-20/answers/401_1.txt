Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model depicts a globe on a stand, which doesn't align well with the text prompt "A cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk."
   - The right model appears to be a sphere on a pedestal, which also doesn't align with the prompt.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more structured and plausible, having a recognizable globe and stand.
   - The right model appears less detailed and more abstract.
   - Left is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has sharper and more detailed textures, especially on the globe.
   - The right model's texture is less detailed.
   - Left is better.

Final answer:
