Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a chair with a red seat. It does not match the text prompt "a triangular shelf with round edges".
   - The right model looks more abstract and potentially like a structure with layers, but it still does not align with the description of a "triangular shelf with round edges."

   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model resembles a typical chair structure, which is solid and plausible, without strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right model seems more abstract and less solid, with a structure that appears to have some floating or disconnected elements.

   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model has a sharper texture and clearer definition, particularly on the seat's surface.
   - The right model's texture seems less detailed and more diffuse.

   The left one is better.

Final answer:
