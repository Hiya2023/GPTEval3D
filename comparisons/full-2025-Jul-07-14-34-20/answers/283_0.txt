I'm unable to see specific details or the text prompt properties in the images you provided. However, based on the guidance for evaluating 3D objects, here's how you can approach the comparison:

Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe the alignment, presence, and details of a rectangular sofa and an oval mirror based on observed features.
