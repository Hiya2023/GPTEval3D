Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a more detailed bookshelf with multiple shelves and books, fitting well with the description of "a rectangular bookshelf."
   - The right one is a simpler design with fewer shelves and no books, also aligning with the description but less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid with a uniform structure and realistic details such as books.
   - The right one, although structurally stable, lacks the realism of added details like the books.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a richer texture with visible book spines and more pronounced details.
   - The right one has a simpler and less detailed texture.
   - The left one is better.
