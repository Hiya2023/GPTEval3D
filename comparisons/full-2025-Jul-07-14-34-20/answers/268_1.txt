I'm unable to view the specific details of the images you provided, but I can guide you on how to perform the analysis.

**Analysis Process:**

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - **Left Object (1):** Does it appear triangular? Are the edges round as described? Is it clearly a shelf with distinct triangular and round features?
   - **Right Object (2):** Does it have a triangular shape? Are the edges rounded? Is it identifiable as a shelf as per the description?

2. **Evaluation:**
   - Compare the shapes and features of both objects to the text prompt description.

**Example Analysis Outcome:**

- **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
  - The left one might (or might not) better capture the triangular shape and round edges of the shelf.
  - The right one might (or might not) better align with the description in terms of shape and function.
  
- Decide which one is better based on how closely they match the description of "A triangular shelf with round edges."

**Final Answer:**
You would then summarize your final decision, selecting either:
1. Left (object 1) is better;
2. Right (object 2) is better;
3. Cannot decide.

If you're able to view the images and can provide your description of each, I could offer more targeted guidance!
