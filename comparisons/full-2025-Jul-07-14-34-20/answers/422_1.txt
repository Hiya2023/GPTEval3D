I'm unable to display or compare images directly, but I can help you analyze their characteristics. Here's how you might evaluate the images based on the given criteria:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:** 
   - **Left Object:** The left object appears to be a globe on a stand, which doesnâ€™t match the given text prompt "A cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk."
   - **Right Object:** The right object also resembles a globe on a more elaborate stand, with no elements aligning to a cylindrical bin or rectangular desk.
   - **Decision:** Cannot decide as neither model corresponds to the text prompt. 

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left Object:** The left model looks like a solid globe, but the representation seems unrealistic and has geometric artifacts.
   - **Right Object:** The right model appears more complex but slightly more realistic and detailed in terms of structure.
   - **Decision:** Right (object 2) is better for being more plausible and consistent.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left Object:** The textures are flat and lack detail.
   - **Right Object:** The textures on the right object seem sharper and more detailed, with a better representation of color and material.
   - **Decision:** Right (object 2) is better for having more detailed textures.

### Final Answer:
3 2 2
