Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a triangular design which doesn't closely resemble a cuboid bookshelf or a circular clock.
   - The right object appears to have a flat, textured surface but still doesn't clearly depict a clock or bookshelf structure.
   - Cannot decide, as neither aligns well with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks more structured and solid with distinct lines and surfaces.
   - The right object appears less coherent and lacks a clear, solid form.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has visible textures and shading, which adds some detail.
   - The right object has unclear textures, making it appear less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
