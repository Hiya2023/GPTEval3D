Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears diamond-shaped rather than triangular.
   - The right one is clearly triangular as described in the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks more solid and uniform in shape despite not being triangular.
   - The right one has visible irregularities in texture, making it less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one has a consistent texture and geometry alignment.
   - The right oneâ€™s textures are not well-aligned with the triangular geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one has smoother and more consistent texture details.
   - The right one has irregular textures that break consistency.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one shows slightly smoother geometry without noise.
   - The right one exhibits some noisy artifacts.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering the criteria, while the right one matches the prompt better, the left one excels in other areas.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
