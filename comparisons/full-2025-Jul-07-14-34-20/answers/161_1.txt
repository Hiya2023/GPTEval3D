Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clearly defined rectangular shape with cylindrical armrests, matching the prompt well.
   - The right one is less defined and does not clearly show cylindrical armrests.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more structured and solid, resembling a plausible sofa.
   - The right model looks less cohesive and more abstract.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model shows a good alignment between the texture and geometry, especially in the armrests.
   - The right model has a less clear alignment.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model captures more refined details in texture without being blurry.
   - The right model's texture appears less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model shows more organized and detailed geometry.
   - The right model looks more chaotic and lacks intricate details.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the left model consistently outperforms the right model.
   - The left one is better.
