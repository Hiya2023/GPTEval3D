Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model resembles a cubic shape with some elements of a lamp and a slightly curved base, but it's not very distinct.
   - The right model also appears cubic with a curved base, relating better to the lamp structure.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and coherent, with fewer distortions or unusual features.
   - The right model seems to blend into the background more, with less distinct 3D presence.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model features detailed and clear textures, providing a more lifelike appearance.
   - The right model has blander and less detailed textures.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
