Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- The left one (object 1) includes a cuboid bookshelf, but it appears to lack a circular clock above it, which is a key part of the description.
- The right one (object 2) depicts a more abstract form, but it doesn't clearly show a cuboid bookshelf or a circular clock as described.

The left one is better because it features a discernible bookshelf, whereas the right one does not clearly reflect elements from the prompt.

Final answer:
1
