Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to have an elliptical shape and circular legs, matching the prompt well.
   - The right model also has a similar shape, but the details are more pronounced and defined.
   
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has some irregularities in shape and lacks definition in the legs.
   - The right model appears more solid and consistent, with well-defined parts and leg structures.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture seems noisy and lacks clarity.
   - The right model has sharper, more realistic textures with more visible details.
   
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
