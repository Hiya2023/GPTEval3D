Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a rounded chair with a green cushion and wooden legs, not aligning with the "triangular shelf with round edges" prompt.
   - The right object also resembles a chair with a rounded shape and base, rather than a triangular shelf.
   - Cannot decide which is better since neither fits the prompt well.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and evenly structured like a proper chair.
   - The right object also appears solid but lacks complexity in structure.
   - The left one is better for plausibility as it appears more stable and realistic as an object.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object shows vibrant colors and clear textures on the cushion and wooden legs.
   - The right object has less distinct textures and appears more diffuse.
   - The left one is better for texture detail and sharpness.

Final answer:
