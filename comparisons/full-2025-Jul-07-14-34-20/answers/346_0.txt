Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a circular seat and seems to allude to a square base but doesn't clearly fulfill the "square base" aspect.
   - The right one has a circular seat and a more distinguished structure that could imply a square base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears consistent with a stool structure, maintaining solidity without appearing strange.
   - The right one is also plausible but the colors can give it an unrealistic look.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a simpler texture, lacking detail.
   - The right one has more detailed texture, particularly with its colorful seat.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
