Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear trapezoidal shape with angled sides and multiple shelves, matching the prompt.
   - The right one resembles more of an A-frame shape and doesn't clearly represent a trapezoidal bookshelf.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid and coherent with a plausible shelf structure.
   - The right one has structural issues and appears less stable or realistic.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper and more defined textures, making it appear more realistic.
   - The right one has a more blurry and less detailed texture.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
