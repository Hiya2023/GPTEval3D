Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a dark object that looks like a nightstand, whereas the right one looks more like a seating furniture piece and does not resemble a lamp on a nightstand. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more plausible for the described objects, while the right one shows irregular shapes that do not align with lamps or nightstands. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures and geometry seem to align better with its intended form. The right one shows mismatched geometry and texture. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has consistent texture details on the nightstand. The right one has more stylized textures inappropriate for the prompt. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object displays more accurate geometry for a nightstand, while the right one doesn't match the expected shape. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all degrees above, the left one better captures the task's requirements.
