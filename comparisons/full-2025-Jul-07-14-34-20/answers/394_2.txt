Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one seems to have a hexagonal shape, which aligns well with the "hexagonal mirror" part of the prompt. However, it lacks a clear triangular frame.
   - The right one appears to incorporate a triangular frame around the mirror, though the mirror itself isn't distinctly hexagonal.
   - The right one is better because it includes the triangular frame mentioned in the prompt, even if the hexagonal aspect is not fully realized.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears solid and consistent, with no obvious structural issues.
   - The right object also looks plausible but seems slightly less stable due to the frame's thinness.
   - The left one is better because it appears more solid and stable.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object has a smoother and more consistent texture, but lacks detail.
   - The right object displays more texture detail, particularly in the frame.
   - The right one is better due to more detailed and realistic textures.

Final answer:
