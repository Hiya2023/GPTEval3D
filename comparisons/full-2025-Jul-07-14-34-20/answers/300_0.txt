Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have a bordered top and decorative legs, which might suggest complexity but seem less square due to the top's inward structure.
   - The right object is more aligned with a traditional square coffee table, with a simple and solid square top.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has some inconsistencies in the legs and border, making it look less plausible as a normal coffee table.
   - The right object appears more solid and plausible, with consistent leg structure and a solid top.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has textures that are less sharp and slightly noisy, detracting from realism.
   - The right object has sharper and more realistic textures, with a consistent wooden appearance.
   - The right one is better.
