Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left one appears irregular, with distorted shapes not clearly resembling a bookshelf.
   - The right one has a more defined rectangular shape and clearer shelf structures.
   - The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left model has fragments and lacks a coherent structure, appearing less solid.
   - The right model has a defined form, with visible shelves and items, looking more plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left model displays inconsistent and blurred textures.
   - The right model shows more distinct textures with visible details like books and a plant.
   - The right one is better.
