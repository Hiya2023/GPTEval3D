I'm unable to directly compare the two objects as described, but I can guide you on how to evaluate images based on the given criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Evaluate how closely each model resembles "a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - Check for the correct representation of both the globe and the pedestal.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Assess which model appears more realistic and natural.
   - Look for any irregularities, such as unnatural shapes or structures.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - Determine if the textures accurately follow the shapes of the models.
   - Ensure that the RGB and normal maps match in terms of structural representation.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Look for fine details in the textures that are sharp and clear.
   - Compare for any blurriness or lack of detail that detracts from realism.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - Focus on the normal maps for intricate geometric details.
   - Evaluate the smoothness and complexity, avoiding noise.

6. **Overall**: 
   - Consider which model meets all the above criteria most effectively.

### Final Decision:
- Based on evaluation, choose which object performs better overall across the criteria.
- Format will be something like: "1 2 1 1 2 1" based on your independent evaluations for each criterion.

You can follow this guideline and apply it to the images you are comparing to make your final decision.
