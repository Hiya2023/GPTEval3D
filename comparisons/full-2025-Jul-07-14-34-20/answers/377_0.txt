Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears rectangular with cylindrical armrests, aligning well with the prompt.
   - The right model also has a rectangular shape and cylindrical cushions that could resemble armrests, but it includes additional pillows that aren't mentioned in the prompt.
   - The left one is better for alignment with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks solid and plausible with no obvious strange parts.
   - The right model has some peculiarities with the structure looking slightly chaotic and less coherent.
   - The left one is better in terms of plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture is smoother but lacks detail.
   - The right model has more detailed and sharp textures, especially on the cushions.
   - The right one is better for texture details.
