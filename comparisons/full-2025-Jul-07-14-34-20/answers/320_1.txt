Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The model appears to have an elliptical tabletop and circular legs, aligning well with the text prompt.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The model also features an elliptical tabletop and circular legs; however, the surface detail on the tabletop seems a bit complex considering the simplicity implied by the prompt.
   - **Decision**: Left (Object 1) is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The model looks solid and plausible, with consistent shapes for the legs and tabletop.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The model also appears solid, but the additional texture on the tabletop may imply unnecessary complexity or strangeness compared to the prompt.
   - **Decision**: Left (Object 1) is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The texture is clear and consistent with the entire object, but slightly less detailed.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The texture is sharp and detailed, especially on the tabletop, providing a more realistic appearance.
   - **Decision**: Right (Object 2) is better.
