Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one looks more like a round shape, while the right one is rectangular. The left better represents a "round stool". Neither clearly depicts a rectangular sofa. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left exhibits more natural proportions and plausible round shapes. The right has an unnatural look.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture and geometry of the left are more consistently aligned, capturing the form accurately as a stool.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left captures finer texture details without being blurry. The right appears less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows smoother and more organized geometry details, while the right has irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is better in terms of alignment with the prompt, plausibility, and details.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
