Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (object 1): Displays a circular top and base, but both are circular, contradicting the "square base" requirement.
   - Right (object 2): Shows a circular top with a base that appears more circular, not convincingly square.
   
Neither model perfectly captures the text description as both have a circular base instead of a square one. 

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
