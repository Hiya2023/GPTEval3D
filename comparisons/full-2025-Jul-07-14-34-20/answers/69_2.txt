Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one does not resemble the prompt description ("A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal") and seems to be a carved object.
   - The right one also does not resemble the prompt and appears more like a cushioned structure.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has irregular, carved shapes that do not align with a simple globe and pedestal.
   - The right one, while more cohesive, still resembles a couch rather than the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one's textures and geometry are mismatched, leading to unclear forms.
   - The right one's textures align more with its geometry, even though it is incorrect per the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one lacks clear detail and appears uniformly textured.
   - The right one presents more detailed textures and depth variation.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one has rough, unclear detailing.
   - The right one shows better structure and smoother contouring.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - While neither aligns with the prompt, the right model exhibits better coherence and detailing.
   - The right one is better.
