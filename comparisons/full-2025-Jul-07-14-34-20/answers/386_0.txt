Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a more irregular shape with potential holes or indents, which may not fully align with a typical square coffee table description.
   - The right one appears more aligned with the expected attributes of a square coffee table, with clearer edges and a more defined top surface.
   - **The right one is better.**

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears to have some irregularities and potential structural issues, which could affect its solidity and plausibility as a normal object.
   - The right model looks more coherent and plausible, with better-defined parts and a more solid appearance.
   - **The right one is better.**

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one lacks distinct texture details, leading to a less defined appearance.
   - The right one shows sharper and more realistic textures with more visible details on its surface.
   - **The right one is better.**
