Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a consistent yellow color and texture that aligns well with the "yellow sofa" prompt. The design is simple and straightforward.
   - The right one, while yellow, has a patterned texture that includes other colors, which deviates from the prompt's simplicity and implies a patterned design instead.

The left one is better as it more accurately reflects the prompt of "a yellow sofa."

Final answer:
