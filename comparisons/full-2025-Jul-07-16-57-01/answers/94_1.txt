Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
The left one is a vase; the right one is a low-table structure. Neither aligns with the prompt of a "brown sofa with black stripes."
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
The left appears solid and plausible as a vase; the right looks plausible as a table.
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
The left one shows consistent geometry and texture; the right one has proper alignment between the texture and geometry in the normal maps.
Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
The left has rich texture details for a vase; the right also shows fine texture details for the table surface.
Cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
The left exhibits intricate geometric details for the vase; the right provides detailed geometry for the table.
Cannot decide.

6. Overall, neither aligns with the given prompt. 
Cannot decide.

Final answer:
3 3 3 3 3 3
