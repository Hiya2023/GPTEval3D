Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one (object 1): The object shows a mix of colors, mainly blue and yellow, which does not align with the "white vase with golden patterns" description.
   - The right one (object 2): The object is more subdued with darker tones and lacks any clear white or golden pattern, also not fitting the description.

Neither object accurately reflects the prompt's specified colors and patterns. However, the right one seems slightly closer due to a hint of lighter colors compared to the left oneâ€™s bright and unrelated color pattern.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
