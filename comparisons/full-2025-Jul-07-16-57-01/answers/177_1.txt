I'm unable to view images directly as you see them. However, I can guide you on how to make the evaluation based on the criteria you listed. Here's a way to proceed:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Examine the color and structure of each model. Look for a purple chair structure with white chair legs. Determine which model more closely matches this description.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Assess the images for realistic proportions and natural formations. Identify any obvious irregularities, such as distortions or duplicated parts. Choose the model that appears more realistic and cohesive.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Check if the textures align properly with the 3D shapes in each model. Ensure that features such as the chair back, seat, and legs are coherent in both RGB and normal maps.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Look for clarity and detail in the visible textures. Determine which model has textures that are sharp and well-defined, without appearing excessively abstract or blurred.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Focus on the fine details captured in the normal maps. The model should present organized, intricate details that contribute to a smooth, visually pleasing appearance.

6. **Overall Decision**: Consider all the criteria to decide which model is better overall in representing the prompt and achieving a coherent 3D structure.

Please review each aspect independently to make a well-informed decision.
