Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object is a basic and abstract representation that lacks clear features typical of a sofa, though it is yellow. 
   - The right object clearly resembles a sofa with visible cushions and armrests. It matches the description of a "yellow sofa" quite well.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears lumpy and lacks a coherent shape that aligns with a usual sofa structure. It seems less plausible as a 3D model.
   - The right object looks more structured and solid with identifiable features like backrests and legs.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a uniform texture with minimal details.
   - The right object has more detailed textures, including patterns that give a more realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.
