```
Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not align with the text prompt of "A brown sofa with black stripes"; the right one also does not align.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one is lacking in detail and structure; the right one appears more solid and less abstract.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. Both do not align well with the intended geometry-texture combination, but the right one shows a more cohesive integration.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one has vague details; the right one shows more defined textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one lacks clarity and detail; the right one has more organized geometric features.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one is more solid and coherent, despite not matching the text prompt.
The right one is better.
