I'm unable to evaluate aspects of specific 3D objects or multi-view images directly. However, I can guide you on how to assess these criteria and suggest what to look for:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Check if the objects align with "A turquoise desk with brass handles". Look for turquoise color and any brass details.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Examine both objects for realistic proportions and shapes. Avoid elements that appear malformed or disproportionately sized.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Verify that textures match the shape of the objects in both RGB and normal images. Look for consistency across surfaces.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Assess the clarity and detail of textures. Avoid blurriness; look for sharp, precise features.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Inspect the normal maps for detailed and coherent geometry without noise.

6. **Overall Decision**: Based on the above assessments, determine which object best meets the criteria.

To conduct this comparison, closely examine all provided multi-view images for each model.
