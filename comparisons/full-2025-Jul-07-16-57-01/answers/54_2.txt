I'm unable to directly view or compare the images provided. However, I can guide you on how to make the evaluation based on the text prompt you mentioned:

"A pink vase on a brown shelf"

Here's how you might assess each criterion:

1. **Text prompt and Asset Alignment:** 
   - Check if each object correctly represents a pink vase on a brown shelf.
   - Ensure that the color and form of the vase and the shelf match the description.
   - Decide which one aligns better with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility:** 
   - Evaluate if the vase and shelf look natural and convincing in 3D space.
   - Examine body proportions and look for any abnormalities or noise.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:** 
   - Assess if the texture follows the geometry of the vase and shelf correctly.
   - Check consistency across RGB and normal images.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:** 
   - Look at the fine textures on the vase and shelf.
   - See which object captures detailed textures better without blurriness.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:** 
   - Examine the detailed structure in the normal maps.
   - Determine which model has smoother and more detailed shapes.

6. **Overall:** 
   - Based on the above aspects, decide which model better fulfills the requirements and aesthetic of the text prompt. 

After evaluating each aspect, you can summarize your final decision as instructed.
