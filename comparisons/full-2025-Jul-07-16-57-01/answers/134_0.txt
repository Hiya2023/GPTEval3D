Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one uses a blue and yellow color scheme aligning with the prompt; the right one is red and blue, which does not match the description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more plausible as a bowl; the right one seems too spherical and solid.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left texture matches the geometric form of a bowl; the right one shows a mismatch in texture and shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has crisp and detailed textures; the right one appears too smooth and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows clearer geometric structure in the normal maps; the right one is overly smooth.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object better fulfills the criteria.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
