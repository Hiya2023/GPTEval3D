Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one includes a variety of colors and shapes not aligned with "a pink and grey cushion". The right one focuses on a single object with a more appropriate color scheme. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has more structured shapes resembling furniture, while the right one has irregular proportions less plausible for a cushion.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows texture somewhat aligned with its shapes; the right one's texture appears loosely mapped.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows intricate textures that match its surfaces; the right one appears abstract and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has structured geometry; the right one contains more noise and irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria, the left one shows better structure and detail, despite not aligning with the prompt.
The left one is better.
