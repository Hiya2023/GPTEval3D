Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is green and the right object is black, which fits the prompt "A black lamp." The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has an irregular shape that appears less plausible, while the right object is more consistent and natural-looking. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows misalignment between its texture and geometry, whereas the right object has better alignment as the black color matches the form. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object looks blurry in texture, while the right object captures more precise details. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The normal map of the left object shows more distortions, whereas the right object maintains smooth geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object aligns well with the criteria of being a black lamp and maintains better quality in structure and texture. The right one is better.
