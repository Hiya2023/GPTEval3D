Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model appears more like generic furniture, but less like a sofa.
   - The right model clearly resembles a sofa with distinct features.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks less defined and has unnatural shapes for a sofa.
   - The right model appears solid and plausible with appropriate structures for a sofa.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left model's textures do not align well with its geometry.
   - The right model exhibits better alignment between texture and shape, especially the upholstery details.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model has simple textures, lacking fine details.
   - The right model displays intricate and realistic textures, including tufting and folds.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left model's geometry lacks complexity and detail.
   - The right model shows detailed, smooth geometry, enhancing realism.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: 
   The right model consistently provides a more accurate and realistic representation of a "yellow sofa" according to the criteria.
   The right one is better.
