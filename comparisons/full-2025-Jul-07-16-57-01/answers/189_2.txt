Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a textured look but varies slightly in color from orange; the right one has a vibrant orange color that more closely matches the prompt. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has more structured and normal armchair proportions; the right one appears slightly distorted in some views. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows texture that aligns better with the armchair shape and structure in normal maps; the right one has texture that sometimes does not match the geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows more texture detail in the surface, though colors are less vivid; the right one has a bright color but lacks detailed texture. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has more detailed shapes and contours; the right one shows smoother but less defined geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model offers better structural integrity and detail alignment, though it slightly lacks in color vibrancy compared to the prompt. The left one is better.

Final answer:
