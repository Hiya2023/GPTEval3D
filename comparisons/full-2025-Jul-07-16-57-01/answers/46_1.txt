Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts a car with some greenery and does not match the description of a "black vase on a brown table".
   - The right one depicts a red car on a brown surface, which also does not align with the text prompt.
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one shows a car that seems to be floating above grass, with some unrealistic elements.
   - The right one has a more solid appearance on a flat surface, though neither looks natural as a vase on a table.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one’s textures do not match the shape well, with greenery on a car.
   - The right one’s textures align better with the geometry, with a clearer car shape even though it still doesn't match the prompt.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has some texture details on the car but is confusing due to mixed elements.
   - The right one retains more clarity and fine details on the car's texture.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has complex but disorganized geometry.
   - The right one presents a smoother, more coherent shape.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, neither aligns with the prompt, but considering solidity and coherence:
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
