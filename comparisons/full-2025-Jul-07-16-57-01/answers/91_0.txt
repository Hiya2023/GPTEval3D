Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a green sofa, not yellow. The right model matches the text prompt with a yellow sofa. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has clearer and more realistic proportions with visible arms and backrest. The right model looks less defined and less plausible as a sofa shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has a good alignment between texture and geometry. The right model lacks clear structure, resulting in poor alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture is clearer albeit the wrong color. The right model's texture is more aligned with the prompt but lacks detail and appears fuzzy.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more detail in the normal map. The right model's details are less pronounced and less clear.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment and detail clarity, the left model excels despite the color mismatch.
The left one is better.
