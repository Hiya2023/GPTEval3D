Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (Object 1) depicts a structure with a flat top and detailed legs, but there are no signs of a cushion or the specified colors of pink and grey.
   - The right one (Object 2) also misses the attributes of a cushion and the colors pink and grey, showing instead an irregularly shaped object with bulging parts.

Neither object aligns well with the prompt of "A pink and grey cushion."

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide, as neither matches the prompt adequately.)
