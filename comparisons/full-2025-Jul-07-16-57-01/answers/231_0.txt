Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model (object 1) appears as an armchair with broad, rounded arms and a more compact shape, but the color seems to be not primarily orange, which does not fully align with the description. The right model (object 2) features a more detailed and traditional armchair style, with visible button tufting and patterns, and it displays an orange hue aligning well with the prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
