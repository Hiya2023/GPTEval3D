Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The text prompt describes "A pink vase on a brown shelf." However, both models depict a red car on a flat surface, which does not match the prompt.

   - Left (object 1): Renderings show a red car against a lighter, earth-toned surface but lack a vase or shelf.
   - Right (object 2): Also presents a red car on a darker surface with no elements of a vase or shelf.

Neither model captures the described objects (pink vase and brown shelf).

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
