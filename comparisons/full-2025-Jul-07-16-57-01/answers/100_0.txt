Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears darker, with less emphasis on the "white" aspect of the table, while the right one better aligns with the description by being visibly white. 
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and natural, while the right one has inconsistencies in texture that affect its plausibility.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has some misalignment between shape and colors, while the right one shows better coherence between its white texture and structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has textures that are dark and appear less detailed, while the right one captures more intricate details in line with a white table.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows better defined geometric structures in the normal maps, whereas the right one looks less precise.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment with the prompt and plausibility, the right one better represents a "white table."
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
