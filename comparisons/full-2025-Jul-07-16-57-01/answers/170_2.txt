I'm unable to generate a comparison based on the given text prompt since the images provided do not depict "a red ball under a blue chair." However, here's a sample output structure you might use after close inspection of images related to your actual 3D models:

"
Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

6. Overall, xxxxxx
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.


Final answer:
x x x x x x (e.g., 1 2 2 3 2 1 / 3 3 3 2 1 3 / 3 2 2 1 1 1)
