I'm unable to compare or analyze the objects as described in the images directly. However, I can guide you on how to assess them based on the criteria.

### Analysis

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Evaluate how well each model represents "a brown sofa with black stripes." Check for color accuracy and the presence of stripes.
   - **Decision**: Determine which model better aligns with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Assess the naturalness and solidity of each model. Look for any distortions or unrealistic features.
   - **Decision**: Choose the more plausible model.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Check how well the textures fit the geometrical shape of each model.
   - **Decision**: Decide which model has better alignment.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Look closely at the texture detail and sharpness.
   - **Decision**: Determine which model captures finer details.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Examine the normal maps for geometrical detail accuracy.
   - **Decision**: Choose the model with better geometric detailing.

6. **Overall**: Based on the above analyses.
   - **Decision**: Select the overall better model.

### Final Decision

- Make individual decisions for each criterion.
- Summarize with a final decision using format like "1 2 2 3 2 1".
