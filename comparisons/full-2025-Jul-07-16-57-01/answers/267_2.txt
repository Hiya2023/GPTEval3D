I'm unable to view or interpret the images you provided, but I can help guide you on how to evaluate them based on the analysis structure you outlined.

1. **Text prompt analysis**: 
   - Verify if the object is a "pink vase" and it's placed on a "brown shelf". Check for both color accuracy and object representation.
   - Evaluate whether the surroundings or additional objects are aligned with what's mentioned or implied in the text.

2. **Left object (1)**:
   - Determine if it effectively reflects the characteristics of a pink vase on a brown shelf.
   - Check color, shape, and position in the multi-view image and rendering.

3. **Right object (2)**:
   - Similarly, evaluate this object for the same criteria.
   - Look for accuracy in the attributes defined by the text prompt and compare against the left object.

After examining both models, you can make a decision as to which one better represents the text prompt. Use the options provided:
1. Left (object 1) is better;
2. Right (object 2) is better;
3. Cannot decide. 

If you follow this procedure, you should be able to determine which model aligns more accurately with the initial description.
