I'm unable to view the images to make a comparison. Based on your description of the task, I can guide you on how to evaluate them. You should examine the following aspects:

1. **Overall Shape and Structure**: Determine if either 3D model resembles the shape of a dresser.

2. **Color and Texture**: Check if the models accurately depict a brown color, which is crucial for matching the prompt.

3. **Details and Features**: Look for characteristic features of a dresser, such as drawers and handles.

4. **Normal Maps**: Assess if the normal maps provide appropriate texture and dimensional details corresponding with a real dresser surface.

If an object aligns better based on the above criteria, choose it. If both poorly resemble the description, state that as you see fit.
