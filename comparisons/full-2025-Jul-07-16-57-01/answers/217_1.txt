I'm unable to view or analyze the contents of the images directly. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the provided text prompt.

To assess the models:

1. Identify whether each object is a black vase on a brown table as per the description.
2. Evaluate the color and shape accuracy of each object in comparison to the text prompt.
3. Consider how well each model captures the relationship between the objects and their environment.

Apply these criteria to each multi-view image sequence to determine which model more accurately reflects the text prompt.

If you can provide descriptions or differences you've noted in the images, I could assist further in making a decision.
