Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model accurately depicts a yellow sofa, while the right model resembles a greenish structure that doesn't match the prompt. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and solid as a sofa, with appropriate proportions, compared to the right model which has irregular textures and shapes. 
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s texture aligns well with its geometry, resembling a sofa. The right model's texture doesn't align well with its form. 
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures the texture of a sofa more effectively without appearing blurry. The right model's texture is confused and noisy.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows smooth and organized geometry consistent with a sofa. The right model is irregular and unrefined.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns better with the prompt and exhibits stronger quality in all evaluated aspects.
   The left one is better.
