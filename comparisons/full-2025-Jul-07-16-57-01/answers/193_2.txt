Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a low table with no resemblance to a sofa. The right one is a vase-like structure. Neither reflects the text description of "a brown sofa with black stripes."
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and plausible as a structured object resembling a table, while the right one is vase-like without context.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture aligns with its flat top and legs, while the right object has stripes not conforming well to its shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clear wooden texture details, while the right object's stripes are blurred and not well-defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is flat and smooth. The right object has irregular surfaces that do not correspond to clear features.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left object, despite not matching the prompt, is more plausible and detailed in its design and texture.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
