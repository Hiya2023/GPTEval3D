Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left image lacks identifiable bowl features, appearing more spherical; the right image resembles a bowl with visible structure. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left image maintains a simple, plausible spherical shape, while the right one has more complex features, though some may look unnatural. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left image shows uniform alignment of texture and shape; the right one has mismatched areas. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left image has clear colors but lacks detail; the right image captures more fine details and variations. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left image is smooth but lacks detail; the right one shows intricate details despite some noise. The right one is better.

6. Overall, combining alignment with text prompt, detail capture, and structure, the right object is better.

Final answer:
