Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures some table-like shape but lacks regular features; The right one looks more like a typical table structure. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears irregular with unstable features; The right one looks more proportionate and table-like.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows inconsistent texture alignment; The right one has textures that align more consistently with its geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows minimal texture detail; The right one has clearer, more coherent textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits unclear geometry; The right one has more defined and plausible shapes.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right one represents a "white table" more accurately.
The right one is better.
