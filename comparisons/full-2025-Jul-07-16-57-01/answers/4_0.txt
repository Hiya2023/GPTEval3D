Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is red, matching the text prompt, but the shapes are distorted. The right one is not red but has a clearer car shape.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears distorted with unnatural shapes. The right one looks more natural and solid.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows poor alignment between texture and shape. The right one has a more consistent alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has blurry textures. The right one captures clearer details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has noisy geometry. The right one displays better-organized details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one consistently performs better across all criteria.
The right one is better.
