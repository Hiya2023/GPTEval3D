I'm unable to provide a detailed analysis for these images. However, I can guide you on how to assess them based on your criteria. You should evaluate each object relative to the text prompt:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Compare how well each object represents a "black vase on a brown table." Check if the shape, color, and arrangement match the description.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Look for realistic proportions and structures in both the RGB and normal images. Ensure there are no strange distortions or artifacts.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Check if the textures correspond correctly with the shape in both the RGB and normal maps.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Assess the sharpness and accuracy of textures, ensuring they aren't blurry or overly abstract.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Examine the normal maps for clean and precise geometry with no unnecessary noise.

Based on your observations, you can determine which object better satisfies each criterion and use that evaluation to decide which one is overall better.
