Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object closely resembles a yellow sofa with its color more accurately represented. The right object appears greener and does not align well with the color aspect of the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more solid and naturally proportioned. The right object looks softer with less defined structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object’s texture aligns well with its shape, maintaining a coherent form. The right object has a noisy texture that does not align well with the geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clear texture details that are more aligned with the concept of a fabric-covered sofa. The right object’s texture lacks clarity and coherence.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has smoother, well-defined geometry. The right object exhibits noise and lacks clear structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all dimensions, the left object more accurately represents the prompt and maintains better quality in texture and geometric details.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
