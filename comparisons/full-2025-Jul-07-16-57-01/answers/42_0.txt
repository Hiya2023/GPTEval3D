I'm unable to recognize people or identify specific objects in images. However, based on what is visible in the images, here's a structured evaluation following the provided criteria:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model depicts an office chair with armrests, while the right model depicts a floral-patterned chair. Neither represents a grey dog or a green bicycle. 
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model's chair appears more realistic with plausible proportions and structure. The right model's chair is also realistic but is more intricate and floral.
   Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows alignment with consistent textures. The right model's textures match well with its geometry, maintaining consistency.
   Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clear textures and details suited for an office chair. The right model features intricate floral patterns and textures.
   Right is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's geometry is clear and smooth. The right model also has clear geometry, but more complex due to the patterns.
   Right is better.

6. Overall, neither clearly aligns with the prompt, but based on texture and geometry details:
   Right is better overall.

Final answer:
3 3 3 2 2 2
