Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is predominantly green, not yellow, and has a more traditional sofa structure with cushions.
   - The right one is clearly yellow but lacks distinct sofa details.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more natural and structured like a traditional sofa.
   - The right one appears less defined and more abstract.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows better alignment between texture and shape.
   - The right one shows misalignment with unclear shapes.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has clear cushion details and texture.
   - The right one appears fuzzy and lacks detail.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one has more defined geometry with recognizable shapes.
   - The right one's geometry is less precise and appears noisy.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   The right captures the color yellow as per the prompt, but the left has better structure and detail.
   The left one is better overall.
