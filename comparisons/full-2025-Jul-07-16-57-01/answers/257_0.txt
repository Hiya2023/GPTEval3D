Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is predominantly dark with a mix of colors and does not clearly reflect the "orange" aspect specified in the prompt. The overall form of an armchair is present, but the color alignment is off.
   - The right one accurately exhibits an orange hue with a clear depiction of an armchair. The color and form align well with the text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
