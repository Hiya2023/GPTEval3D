I'm unable to analyze the images directly. However, I can guide you on how to conduct the analysis based on the criteria provided. Here's what to consider:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
   - Describe each model.
   - Evaluate how closely each model aligns with the text prompt, "A blue and yellow bowl." Look for color accuracy, shape, and elements.

2. **3D Plausibility:** 
   - Assess which model appears more natural and plausible as a 3D object. Check for realistic shapes, proportions, and structures.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:** 
   - Determine how well the texture matches the geometry. Ensure the texture complements the form and adds to the realism.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:** 
   - Inspect the texture details closely for clarity and detail. Avoid blurriness and ensure it fits the aesthetic.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:** 
   - Examine the normal maps for detailed and smooth geometry. Avoid noise and ensure the structure is well-organized.

6. **Overall Decision:**
   - Based on the above criteria, determine which model better suits the task. Use independent decisions from each criterion to conclude.

If youâ€™re able, compare the elements in each image as advised and judge based on those observations.
