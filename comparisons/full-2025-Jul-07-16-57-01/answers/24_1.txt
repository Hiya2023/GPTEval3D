I'm unable to directly access or analyze the images provided, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on your criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left**: Describe how well the object matches "a black vase on a brown table."
   - **Right**: Describe how well the object matches "a black vase on a brown table."
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left**: Evaluate how naturally the object forms a conceivable 3D model.
   - **Right**: Evaluate how naturally the object forms a conceivable 3D model.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - **Left**: Assess how well the texture aligns with the geometry.
   - **Right**: Assess how well the texture aligns with the geometry.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - **Left**: Examine the sharpness and detail in the texture.
   - **Right**: Examine the sharpness and detail in the texture.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - **Left**: Look at the intricacy and clarity of geometry in the normal map.
   - **Right**: Look at the intricacy and clarity of geometry in the normal map.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

6. **Overall**: Combine insights from above criteria.
   - Decision: The left/right one is better or cannot decide.
