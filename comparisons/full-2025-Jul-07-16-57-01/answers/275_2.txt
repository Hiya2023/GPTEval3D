Based on the prompt "A white vase with golden patterns," the evaluation is as follows:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1):** The object is primarily blue with yellow patterns, lacking the white color and golden pattern specified in the text prompt.
   - **Right (object 2):** The object appears to have a mix of colors but tends toward yellow, lacking the clear white base and golden patterns needed to match the prompt accurately.
   
Both objects fail to align closely with the prompt as neither prominently features white with golden patterns.

The left one is somewhat closer due to the pattern alignment, but neither fulfills the text prompt well.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
