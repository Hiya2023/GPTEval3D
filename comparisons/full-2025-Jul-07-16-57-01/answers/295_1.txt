Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) depicts a bicycle with a different color scheme, not matching the text description of a "purple chair with white legs."
   - The right one (object 2) depicts a dog, which also does not align with the description of a "purple chair with white legs."

Both objects fail to meet the text prompt, but neither closely resembles the prompt. Thus, neither can be evaluated as better.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
