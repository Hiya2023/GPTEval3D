Sure, let's analyze the two 3D objects based on the criteria provided.

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The text prompt specifies "A turquoise desk with brass handles." Both objects do not represent a desk but instead show vases, and neither turquoise nor brass handle elements are visible in the objects. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: Both objects appear to have similar vase-like shapes. There aren't any serious irregularities, but both deviate significantly from the prompt requirements. 
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: Both objects seem to have consistent alignments between their geometry and texture, maintaining similar patterns in RGB and normal maps. 
Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has more consistent textures than the right one, which appears to have random texture and color noise. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: Both objects exhibit smooth geometry and lack high-frequency detail noise. The structure is well-organized, but neither aligns with the prompt. 
Cannot decide.

6. Overall, neither object properly aligns with the prompt, but the left object maintains better texture detail which slightly edges it ahead. 
The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 3 3 1 3 1
