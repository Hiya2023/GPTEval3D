I'm unable to see or evaluate the specific details of these images. However, I can guide you on how to approach the comparison based on the criteria you provided.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Evaluate which model more accurately represents a "turquoise desk with brass handles."

2. **3D Plausibility**: Assess which model appears more natural and solid. Check for irregularities or unrealistic features.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Determine which model has better alignment between textures and geometry.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Observe which model captures finer texture details more effectively.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Evaluate which model has more intricate and well-defined geometric details.

6. **Overall**: Considering all aspects, decide which model is better.

For each criterion, choose whether the left or right model is better, or if a decision cannot be made. Summarize your evaluations in the final answer format.
