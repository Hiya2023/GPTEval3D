I'm unable to view or analyze the images directly, but based on your instructions and the prompt "A grey dog beside a green bicycle," I can guide you on how to evaluate the models using the criteria.

Here's how you might proceed with the analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:** Evaluate which model better represents a grey dog and a green bicycle. Check for the presence and accurate depiction of both objects, their colors, and their spatial relationship.

2. **3D Plausibility:** Consider which model feels more realistic and solid. Look for correct proportions and the absence of any awkward or implausible features.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:** Check the consistency between the RGB and normal maps. The shapes and colors should match well on both the RGB image and its normal map counterpart.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:** Analyze which model captures more fine texture details without blur, focusing on the small elements of the objects.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:** Assess the normal maps for detailed and smooth geometry that represents the intended shapes effectively.

6. **Overall Decision:** After considering all the criteria, decide which model closely aligns with the text prompt and quality standards.

Apply these analyses to each model and decide for each criterion based on the visible characteristics described in your prompt and comparative criteria.
