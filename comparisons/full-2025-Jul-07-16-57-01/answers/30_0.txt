Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model is fuzzy and lacks distinct form, deviating from the simple description of a "yellow sofa." The right model represents a sofa with clear structure and recognizable features. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears abstract and lacks realistic shape and solidity. The right model has a more structured and plausible appearance for a sofa. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's geometry and texture do not align well, impacting recognition. The right model shows better alignment with texture following its geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture is inconsistent and lacks clarity. The right model captures more refined details that fit the prompt's simple description. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has indistinct and unrefined geometry, while the right model features clearer and more intricate geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model consistently represents the prompt with a realistic and aligned depiction of a yellow sofa.
The right one is better.
