Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model does not resemble a brown dresser; it appears to be a vase with abstract patterns.
   - The right model also resembles a vase with abstract patterns, not a brown dresser.
   The left one is better because it has a more uniform appearance, though neither fits the prompt well.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and natural with consistent proportions.
   - The right model has some irregularities in the form and texture.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture aligns well with its shape, maintaining consistent patterns.
   - The right model shows inconsistencies between its texture and geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model has clear and detailed textures, with well-captured intricate designs.
   - The right model's texture appears noisy and less coherent.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has more smooth and organized geometry with detailed patterns.
   - The right model has some irregularities and noise in the geometry.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model is better despite neither fitting the prompt significantly.

Final answer:
