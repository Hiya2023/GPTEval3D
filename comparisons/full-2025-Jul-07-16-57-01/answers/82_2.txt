I'm unable to view the images you've provided. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on your description. Here's a structured approach:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - *Left (object 1)*: Describe how well it matches the "black vase on a brown table" prompt.
   - *Right (object 2)*: Describe how well it matches the "black vase on a brown table" prompt.
   - Decide which one better represents the prompt details.
   
2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - *Left (object 1)*: Describe its naturalness, solidity, and any irregularities.
   - *Right (object 2)*: Describe its naturalness, solidity, and any irregularities.
   - Decide which one appears more plausible as a 3D object.
   
3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - *Left (object 1)*: Assess how well textures adhere to the geometry.
   - *Right (object 2)*: Assess how well textures adhere to the geometry.
   - Decide which model has better alignment.
   
4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - *Left (object 1)*: Analyze the fine texture details.
   - *Right (object 2)*: Analyze the fine texture details.
   - Determine which has better fine details.
   
5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - *Left (object 1)*: Evaluate the normal map details.
   - *Right (object 2)*: Evaluate the normal map details.
   - Decide which has more accurate and neat geometry details.
   
6. **Overall Decision:**
   - Summarize your findings to determine which object is overall better.

**Final Answer Format:**
1 2 2 3 2 1 (replace with your decisions based on analysis)

If you have specific parts of the image or model that you'd like to describe, I can help based on textual descriptions.
