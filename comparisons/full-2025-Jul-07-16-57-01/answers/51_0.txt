I'm unable to view or compare images directly. However, I can provide guidance on how to evaluate the aspects mentioned. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Examine both models for blue and yellow colors and bowl-like shapes. Check if both reflect these criteria accurately.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Evaluate if both models appear natural without irregular shapes or proportions. See if they have the solidity and structure expected of a real bowl.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Check if textures match the geometry on both models. A bowl should have consistent textures aligning with its shape in the RGB and normal images.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Look for fine details in the textures on both models. The textures should be clear and not blurry unless specified otherwise.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Evaluate the normal images for geometry detail. The structure should be consistent and not noisy.

6. **Overall**: Weigh all the aspects equally to determine which model overall is closer to the desired outcome.

If you follow this structured analysis, you can determine which model meets the criteria better overall and make a decision.
