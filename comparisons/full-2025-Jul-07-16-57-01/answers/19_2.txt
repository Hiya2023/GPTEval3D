Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model shows a multicolored table with four distinct legs, while the right model is more abstract with an unclear base. Neither accurately depicts a "white table," but the left aligns slightly better due to basic table attributes. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left model shows a realistic table structure with four legs, while the right model appears unstable with a single central support. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left model demonstrates a more coherent alignment of texture and geometry, while the right has mismatched texture with the geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left model displays clearer leg texture details, whereas the right has noise and less definition. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left model's legs have clearer geometric detail and structure, while the right is less defined. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns better with the intended prompt and exhibits stronger realism in structure and detail. The left one is better.

Final answer:
