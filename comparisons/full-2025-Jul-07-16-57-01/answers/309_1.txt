Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) appears to be a blue chair with a curved back and visible legs, consistent with the prompt "A blue chair."
   - The right one (object 2) also depicts a blue chair but the lighting makes it slightly harder to discern the blue color vividly.
   - The left one is better as it visibly aligns more with the prompt in terms of color and structure.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one (object 1) seems to have a solid and coherent structure with no obvious distortions or duplicate parts.
   - The right one (object 2) also maintains a plausible 3D structure but appears to be slightly less defined in terms of detailing.
   - The left one is better for having a more straightforward and solid structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one (object 1) shows some texture detail, but it appears somewhat fuzzy.
   - The right one (object 2) has a sharper texture detail, particularly on the legs and seat.
   - The right one is better due to sharper and more detailed textures.
