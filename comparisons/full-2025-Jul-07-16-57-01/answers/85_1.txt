I'm unable to provide an analysis directly from images without being able to view them. However, I can guide you on how to approach your analysis using the provided criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
   - Assess if the objects and their surroundings match the text prompt "A yellow cat on a white sofa".
   - Check how accurately each model reflects the attributes mentioned like color and setting.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Examine each model for natural proportions and solid construction.
   - Note any irregularities such as disproportionate features or extraneous parts.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Determine how well the texture follows the shapes and forms in both the RGB and normal images.
   - Ensure that textures appear coherent with the 3D geometry.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Look closely at textures to see which model captures fine details effectively.
   - Evaluate if textures are clear and aligned with the aesthetic expectation.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Focus on the detail and organization of shapes.
   - Check for a well-structured and smooth representation in the normal maps.

6. **Overall:**
   - Based on the evaluations above, decide which model is better overall.

### Final answer:

Without directly comparing images, you should be able to decide which model is better for each criterion. Remember to use the third option sparingly if you cannot decide.
