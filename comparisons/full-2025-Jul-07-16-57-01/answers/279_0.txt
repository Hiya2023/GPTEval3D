Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

   - Left (object 1): The model appears to be a simple solid red sphere with no blue or yellow, which does not align with the text prompt of a "blue and yellow bowl."

   - Right (object 2): The model features a more complex shape with blue and possible hints of yellow elements, resembling a bowl structure and thus aligning better with the color and structure described in the prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
