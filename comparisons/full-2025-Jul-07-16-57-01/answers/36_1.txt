Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object does not resemble a brown dresser at all. The right object also does not reflect the description of a "brown dresser." Both are vases. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object seems more irregular in shape and texture. The right object appears more natural and solid. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows disjointed texture in relation to its geometry. The right object has a more cohesive appearance where the texture fits well with the shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has a less defined texture. The right object captures more intricate detail in the texture. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has a noisy, disordered shape. The right object offers a more detailed, organized appearance. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object better satisfies the criteria for plausibility, alignment, and details.
