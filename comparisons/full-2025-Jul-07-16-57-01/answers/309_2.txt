{"text":"Analysis:\n1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one is a blue chair with simple design and visible texture, matching the prompt well. The right one also represents a blue chair but appears darker with less visible structure.\nThe left one is better.\n\n2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a solid form with clear shapes and no apparent anomalies; the right one has a plausibly structured chair but is less defined in terms of detail.\nThe left one is better.\n\n3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has sharper and more detailed texture, whereas the right one has a less distinct texture.\nThe left one is better.\n\nFinal answer:\n1 1 1"}
