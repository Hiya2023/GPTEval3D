Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- The left one (Object 1) features a visually complex design with a multicolored and floral-like pattern, which does not align precisely with the "orange armchair" prompt. The shape of the armchair is recognizable, but the color deviates significantly from plain orange.
  
- The right one (Object 2) accurately captures the concept of an "orange armchair." It has an orange upholstery with a tufted design and maintains a realistic armchair structure. The simplicity and color are more aligned with the prompt.

The right one is better.
