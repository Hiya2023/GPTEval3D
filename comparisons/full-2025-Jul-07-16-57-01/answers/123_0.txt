Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more complex pedestal structure; the right one is simpler and aligns more closely with a standard table design. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one's base appears overly ornate, which may not be plausible for a typical table design. The right one's design is more balanced and natural. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The texture aligns better with the simpler geometry of the right model, leading to a more coherent appearance. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. Both models capture fine details, but the right one has textures that are less noisy and more consistent. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The right one's geometry is more straightforward and efficient, delivering a clean and organized structure. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria, the right model consistently performs better.
