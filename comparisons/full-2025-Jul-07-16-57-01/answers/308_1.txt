I'm unable to view live images, but I can help you analyze them in a hypothetical context. Since the images are of 3D objects and the text prompt is "A pink vase on a brown shelf," here's how you could potentially analyze them:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left:** Describe what the left object looks like. Is there a pink vase and a brown shelf? 
   - **Right:** Describe what the right object looks like. Does it depict the same prompt accurately?
   - Based on your observations, decide which object corresponds to the prompt better.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left:** Imagine a 3D model from the left images. Does it appear normal, solid, and plausible? Are there any oddities or meaningless features?
   - **Right:** Consider the plausibility of the right object. Are there strange issues?
   - Determine which model appears more plausible as a solid 3D object.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left:** Focus on local textures in the left images. Are they sharp, realistic, and detailed?
   - **Right:** Examine the right imagesâ€™ textures with the same criteria.
   - Decide which object has more detailed and realistic textures.

### Final Answer:
- Please provide your evaluation for each criterion using the format "(1 2 2)" based on your detailed observations.
