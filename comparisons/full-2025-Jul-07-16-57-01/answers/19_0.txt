Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left table is closer to a typical table structure with four legs; the right one has a single central leg, which is less common for tables. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural with standard table proportions and structure; the right one, with its single leg, seems less plausible. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left table's texture and shape align well, showing clear separation between the tabletop and legs; the right one has a more blended appearance. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object shows more defined and less blurry textures compared to the right. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has clearer geometry with intricate leg details, while the right one lacks this definition. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one is consistently closer to the described 3D table. The left one is better.
