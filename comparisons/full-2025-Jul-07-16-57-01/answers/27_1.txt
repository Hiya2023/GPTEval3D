Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a textured vase with swirl patterns, not matching a "brown dresser"; the right one is a textured vase with a complex pattern, also not matching. Both fail to represent a dresser.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more cohesive with smoother shape transitions; the right one has intricate patterns that may cause geometric irregularities.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture somewhat aligns with the geometry; the right one has more pronounced misalignment with texture patterns that don't match the vase's geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clearer texture details and appears less noisy than the right one, which shows overly complex patterns.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother and more consistent shapes; the right one has complex geometry that may not represent realistic details well.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one provides a more plausible 3D model despite not matching the prompt.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
