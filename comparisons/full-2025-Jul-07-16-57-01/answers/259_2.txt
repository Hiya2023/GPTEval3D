Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) is colorful with a floral pattern that lacks focus on the primary attribute, which is the color orange. The details do not align well with a typical armchair's appearance.
   - The right one (object 2) closely resembles a traditional armchair with a tufted design and has an orange-ish hue, better aligning with the prompt of "an orange armchair."

The right one is better.

Final answer:
