I'm unable to identify or describe the contents of the images. However, I can help you analyze the aspects of Text prompt and Asset Alignment. Since the prompt involves "a purple chair with white legs," you would need to compare the details according to these criteria:

1. Presence of a chair: Ensure both 3D models clearly depict a chair.
2. Color accuracy: Check if the chair is predominantly purple.
3. Leg color accuracy: Verify if the legs of the chair are white.
4. Overall alignment: Determine how each model aligns with the surroundings described, considering materials and proportions.

After analyzing based on these criteria, you should be able to decide if:
1. Left (object 1) is better;
2. Right (object 2) is better;
3. Cannot decide.

Please apply this framework as you examine the images.
