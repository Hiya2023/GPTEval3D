Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a wrinkled, abstract yellow shape, while the right clearly resembles a yellow sofa with cushions. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks irregular and abstract, whereas the right one is more structured, resembling a real sofa.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture does not align with any discernible sofa shape, while the right one shows matching structure in the RGB and normal images.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model appears blurry and lacks clear details, while the right one captures the texture of a sofa more accurately.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model displays random geometry, whereas the right one has well-organized geometry corresponding to a sofa.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model accurately represents a yellow sofa in terms of both texture and geometry.
The right one is better.
