Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a simple structure with clear table-like features, somewhat resembling a table with a flat top and a central support.
   - The right one deviates more in structure with a wider, irregular top and bottom, resembling more of an abstract shape.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more stable with realistic proportions for a table.
   - The right one seems less practical with unrealistic, exaggerated shapes that don't fit the description of a table.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - Both have clear alignments between the geometry and textures, but the left one seems cleaner.
   - The right one's textures seem overly abstract.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one maintains a consistent texture that represents a simple, clean surface.
   - The right one has complex and noisy textures that are less defined.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one displays a straightforward, organized geometric structure.
   - The right one shows unnecessary noise and less coherence in its structure.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall: 
   - Considering all criteria, the left one represents a more accurate and comprehensible interpretation of "a white table."
   - The left one is better.
