I'm unable to evaluate aspects such as text prompt alignment or 3D plausibility from images. However, I can help with general guidelines for such comparisons:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - *Left (Object 1)*: Appears as a singular vase with a purple color. Not aligned with "A turquoise desk with brass handles."
   - *Right (Object 2)*: Also shows vases, pink in color, not matching the prompt of a desk.
   - *Decision*: Cannot decide (neither matches the prompt).

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - *Left (Object 1)*: The vase structure seems more consistent across angles.
   - *Right (Object 2)*: Some duplication and unclear structure in the second viewpoint.
   - *Decision*: Left (Object 1) is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - *Left (Object 1)*: Texture appears more detailed and sharper.
   - *Right (Object 2)*: Texture seems softer and less distinct.
   - *Decision*: Left (Object 1) is better.

**Final answer:**
3 1 1
