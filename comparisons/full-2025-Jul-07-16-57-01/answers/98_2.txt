I'm unable to assess or compare images directly. However, I can guide you on how you might evaluate them based on the criteria provided.

For each model, consider the following:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Check if each model has a purple chair with white legs. Focus on color accuracy, object shape, and any additional details described in the text.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Identify if the models look realistic and natural. Check for correct proportions, a cohesive structure, and the absence of unrealistic or extraneous elements.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Ensure that the texture accurately matches the geometry. Both the RGB and normal map should reflect the same structures and details.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Examine close-up details on the RGB textures. Look for sharpness and accuracy; textures should not appear abstract unless specified.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Focus on the intricacy and coherence of the geometry as shown in the normal maps. The details should enhance, not detract, from the overall form.

6. **Overall Evaluation**: Taking into account all the above aspects, decide which model aligns closest with the desired outcome described in the prompt.

You can apply these criteria to determine which model better satisfies the prompt and overall expectations. If you have any other questions or need assistance interpreting results, feel free to ask!
