Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one includes a tufted backrest, matching an armchair description better, while the right one is simpler. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a well-defined structure and plausible proportions. The right one appears less defined and somewhat flat. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows textures conforming to the tufted design in the normal map. The right one lacks this detail. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has detailed textures in terms of the fabric pattern, while the right one is smoother and less detailed. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one presents intricate tufting details, which the right one does not exhibit. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one combines detailed geometry, texture, and alignment fitting the prompt best. The left one is better.
