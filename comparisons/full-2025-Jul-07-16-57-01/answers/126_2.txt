Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object resembles a round table, while the right object resembles a rectangular table. The prompt specifies "a white table," without detailing the form. Both align differently, but the right one is more conventional for a "table."
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has an unusual pedestal-style base for a standard table, while the right one looks like a typical four-legged table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The right object's textures align well with its geometry, while the left one appears to have less coherence between shape and texture.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right object presents clearer textures without blurring; the left one seems less detailed.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The right object's details are more refined, with clear lines and structure. The left one appears less defined.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object consistently meets the criteria more effectively across all aspects.
The right one is better.
