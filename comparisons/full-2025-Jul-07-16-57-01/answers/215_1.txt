I'm unable to view or evaluate images directly, but I can help guide you on how to analyze them based on your descriptions:

Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: The prompt specifies "A pink vase on a brown shelf."
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe if it captures a pink vase on a brown shelf—check the color, texture, and proportion.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Describe if it fulfills the prompt—identify any color or form discrepancies.

Consider the accuracy of colors and alignment as described. Choose which object better reflects the prompt.

Final answer:
1 / 2 / 3 (Choose based on your analysis)
