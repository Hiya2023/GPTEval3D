I'm unable to identify the contents of the images directly. However, I can guide you through evaluating the criteria if you describe the features of each object based on the text prompt, "A black vase on a brown table." 

Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Describe how each model represents "a black vase on a brown table."
   - Assess whether both components (vase and table) are present and correctly colored.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - Consider whether each model appears solid and realistic.
   - Check for any unnatural distortions or abnormalities.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - Evaluate if the textures align with the shape of the object locally.
   - Confirm that both RGB and normal maps present consistent structures.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - Analyze the clarity and detail of the textures.
   - Determine if the texture is detailed without being blurry.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - Focus on the accuracy of the shapes in the normal maps.
   - Consider the presence of fine details without noise.

Based on your observations, make individual assessments using the given options:

- Left (object 1) is better
- Right (object 2) is better
- Cannot decide

Finally, make your overall decision by compiling these assessments.
