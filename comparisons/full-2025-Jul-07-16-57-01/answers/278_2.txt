Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one (object 1) is primarily red rather than orange, which does not align well with the prompt "An orange armchair." The right one (object 2) has a more orange hue and a clearer representation of an armchair design, with detailed texture and structure visible in the multi-view images.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
