I'm unable to directly analyze images or determine details. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate the models using the given criteria. Hereâ€™s how you can proceed with your evaluation:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Evaluate how well each model represents "a purple chair with white legs." Check if the color and shape align with the description.
   - Compare the presence of the chair and leg colors in each model.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Assess the realism and structure of each model. Check for correct proportions and natural appearance.
   - Look for any irregularities or unnatural features.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - Examine if textures are aligned with the geometry in both models.
   - Compare if the textures follow the shapes accurately.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Focus on the clarity and detail of the textures in each model.
   - Check for any blurriness and compare the aesthetic quality.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - Assess the intricacy and smoothness of geometrical structures in the normal maps.
   - Compare how well-organized and detailed the shapes are.

6. **Overall Decision**:
   - Synthesize the findings from the above criteria to choose which model is better overall.

### Final Answer

Summarize your evaluation with a sequence of numbers representing each criterion. For instance: 

```
2 1 1 2 1 1
```

Feel free to perform this analysis based on a detailed examination of the images.
