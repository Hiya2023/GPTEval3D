I'm unable to visually interpret or analyze images directly. However, I can guide you to evaluate them based on the criteria provided.

Please closely examine each object in terms of:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Does either object resemble a "brown dresser"? 
   - How well do they reflect that description in terms of color and shape?

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Do both objects appear natural and solid?
   - Are there any irregular proportions or duplicated parts?

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - Does the texture align with the geometry?
   - Do both RGB and normal images show consistent shapes?

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Which model captures finer details better without blurriness?

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - Which modelâ€™s normal map represents shapes more accurately and smoothly?

6. **Overall Evaluation**: 
   - Considering all criteria, which one do you find better?

Compare each criterion independently, and then combine your observations to make an overall decision.
