I'm unable to provide a comparison for the 3D objects based on the given images. However, I can offer guidance on how to evaluate them based on the text prompt "A pink vase on a brown shelf."

To effectively compare the two 3D objects, check for the following:

1. **Color Accuracy**: Verify if the vase is pink and the shelf is brown in each model.

2. **Alignment & Structure**: Assess if the vase is correctly positioned on the shelf.

3. **Detailing**: Look for any additional textures or elements that might be mentioned in the text prompt but are not accurately represented in the models.

After evaluating these elements, you can determine which model better matches the text description.
