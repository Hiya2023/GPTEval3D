Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears to depict a wooden table-like object, not a sofa. The right one seems to depict a dark-colored vase, not a sofa either. Neither corresponds well to "A brown sofa with black stripes."
The left one is better, though neither matches the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object is more solid and realistically shaped, resembling a functional object, while the right object is vase-like and smooth but not representative of a sofa.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture aligns with its geometry, showing a wooden surface. The right one aligns its texture with a vase shape.
Cannot decide, as both are well-aligned with their respective geometries.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has detailed wooden textures, while the right one has smooth, dark textures.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has intricate details like slats, while the right one shows a smooth surface.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, neither matches the prompt well, but the left one exhibits better 3D characteristics.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
