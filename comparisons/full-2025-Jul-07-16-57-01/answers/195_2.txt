Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one mainly uses cyan and doesn't depict a cushion-like shape. The right one also lacks a cushion shape but incorporates more colors and decorative elements. Neither aligns well with "a pink and grey cushion."
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks realistic shapes and proportions with unusual extensions. The right one resembles a table but not a cushion; however, it appears more structured and natural.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has inconsistent texture and geometry alignment. The right one showcases a better match between texture and 3D shape, with more logical placement of colors and patterns.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks detail and appears abstract. The right one has intricate patterns and coloring that are more refined and detailed.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows irregular shapes and disorganized geometry. The right one presents a well-defined structure with better-organized geometric details.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one demonstrates better 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, texture details, and geometry details.
   The right one is better.
