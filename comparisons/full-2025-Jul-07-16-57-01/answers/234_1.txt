Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not appear to align closely with the prompt of "a white vase with golden patterns," as it seems to be a bowl with no visible golden patterns. The right one also does not match the text prompt well, as it's similarly more of a bowl without white or golden patterns. 

Since neither object matches the description of a "white vase with golden patterns," it is difficult to determine which is superior in terms of alignment with the prompt.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
