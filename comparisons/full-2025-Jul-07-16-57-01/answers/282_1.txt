I'm unable to view or assess the images directly, but I can help you analyze how to evaluate 3D objects based on their correspondence to the text prompt "A pink vase on a brown shelf." Here's a structured approach to compare them:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Check if there's a clear depiction of a pink vase on a brown shelf. Look for color accuracy (pink for vase, brown for shelf) and correct object positioning. Evaluate the overall shape and detail of the vase.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Similarly, assess if the vase is pink and placed on a brown shelf. Ensure the same level of detail and correct color representation as in the text prompt.

Make sure both models reflect the prompt accurately in color, shape, and context (vase on a shelf). Note any discrepancies or strengths.

**Final Decision**:
Based on alignment with the text prompt about colors, object rendering, and placement:

- If one object is clearly more accurate to the description, choose that object as better.
- If both objects equally fail or succeed in matching the description, and no clear preference is evident, you can choose the third option.

For this specific task, since I cannot view the images, you'll need to apply this framework and decide among the three options based on your observations.
