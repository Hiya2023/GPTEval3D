Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one clearly depicts a yellow fish-like object rather than a cat, and there's no indication of a sofa. The right one looks like a bowl or some abstract object, not aligning with the text prompt of a cat on a sofa at all.

Neither model effectively represents "A yellow cat on a white sofa." However, the left object somewhat captures an animal form, albeit incorrectly, whereas the right is entirely unrelated.

Final answer:
1 (Left is marginally better but still incorrect per the prompt)
