Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a complete table with four legs, but the texture is not white. The right model has a single central leg and incorrect texture/color. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more table-like and plausible with standard structure, while the right model has an unrealistic shape. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's geometry and texture generally align better, though not perfectly. The right modelâ€™s alignment is unclear and less effective. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture is clearer and displays more coherent details despite the incorrect color. The right model is less detailed and blurry. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more defined geometric details in the normal map compared to the right. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model consistently outperforms in all criteria. The left one is better.

Final answer:
