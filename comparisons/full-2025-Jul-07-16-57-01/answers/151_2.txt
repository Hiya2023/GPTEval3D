Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left sofa is uniformly yellow but appears irregular and less like a traditional sofa.
   - The right sofa is a more traditional style, matching the prompt description better.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left sofa has inconsistent shapes and proportions.
   - The right sofa looks more solid, natural, and well-proportioned.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left sofa has mismatched textures and geometry.
   - The right sofa shows better alignment between texture and structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left sofa's texture appears abstract and lacks detail.
   - The right sofa's texture has clearer, realistic details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left sofa's geometry is noisy and disorganized.
   - The right sofa's geometry is more structured and refined.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right sofa is better in terms of alignment, plausibility, texture detail, and geometry.
   The right one is better.
