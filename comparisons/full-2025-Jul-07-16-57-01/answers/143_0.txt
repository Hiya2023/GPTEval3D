Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one resembles a vase with floral patterns; the right one resembles a more ornate vase. Neither appears as a "brown dresser."  
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more cohesive texture and realistic shape for a vase; the right one shows more intricate designs but lacks a natural appearance.  
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one exhibits better alignment as the texture matches the vase shape; the right one's complex patterns do not align cleanly with the vase geometry.  
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures finer, more distinct floral details; the right one appears overly stylized and abstract.  
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one maintains a consistent vase shape with clear details; the right one has complex designs but lacks coherent detail in form.  
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one better aligns with criteria for texture, geometry, and plausibility.  
The left one is better.
