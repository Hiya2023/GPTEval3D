Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model exhibits a rectangular table with four legs, but it is not white.
   - The right model has a round table with a pedestal base, also not white.
   - The left one better corresponds to a typical table shape.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has a more realistic table proportion with solid legs.
   - The right model appears less stable due to the single pedestal.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model aligns the texture with its rectangular table shape.
   - The right model shows some misalignment between texture and shape.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model has clearer, although not white, textures on the table.
   - The right model's textures are more abstract and less defined.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model features more refined geometry, especially with the legs.
   - The right model presents irregular geometry, particularly around the base.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects:
   - The left one consistently provides a more plausible, aligned, and detailed representation.
   - The left one is better.
