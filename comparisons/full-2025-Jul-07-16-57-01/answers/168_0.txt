I'm unable to access or view the contents of images directly. However, based on the text prompt and evaluation criteria provided, I can guide you on how to evaluate the models:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Check if each model looks like a brown dresser. Examine the shape, size, and color. Are key characteristics of a dresser visible? Does it align with the description?

2. **3D Plausibility**: Assess if each model looks like a plausible 3D object. Does it have a realistic shape? Are there any irregularities in the structure that make it look unnatural?

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Look at the correspondence between textures and shapes. Does the texture fit the geometry well in both models? Check if the surface details match the shape outlines.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Focus on the textures' clarity and detail level. Is the texture detailed without being too stylized or abstract? Does it match the aesthetic expectations for a dresser?

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Investigate the geometry for detail and smoothness. Is it well-organized and true to the expected structure for a dresser?

6. **Overall**: Considering all the above, determine which model better represents a "brown dresser."

Based on these guidelines, you should be able to perform the analysis as instructed and reach a conclusion.
