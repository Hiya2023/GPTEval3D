Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears as a classic armchair shape. The right object matches the text description with a more typical armchair form, although it's less orange. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has disproportionate and irregular shapes. The right one has a more realistic armchair appearance. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture appears chaotic and does not align well with its geometry. The right object's texture aligns more closely with its geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object appears blurry with less distinct details. The right object exhibits more defined and appealing textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has noisy details without clear geometry. The right object presents more coherent and detailed geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object demonstrates superior alignment with the text prompt, plausibility, and detail alignment across all criteria. The right one is better.
