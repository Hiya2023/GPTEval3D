I'm unable to view specific visual content, including the images you've provided here. However, I can guide you on how to perform the evaluation:

1. **Examine Object 1 (Left):**
   - Check the color scheme: Are there shades of pink and grey?
   - Assess the texture and shape: Does it resemble a cushion?
   - Evaluate whether all details in the prompt are covered.

2. **Examine Object 2 (Right):**
   - Analyze the color scheme for pink and grey shades.
   - Consider the texture and form: Is it cushion-like?
   - Determine if it captures the description accurately.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Compare both objects based on how closely they match the text prompt.
   - Consider which one better reflects the described attributes.

Pick the object that best aligns with the color scheme and form described in "A pink and grey cushion."

Final answer:
- Decide based on which object better matches the description or choose "cannot decide" if both are equally matched.
