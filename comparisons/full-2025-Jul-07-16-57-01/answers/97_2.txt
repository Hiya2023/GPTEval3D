Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one looks like a piece of furniture and doesn't resemble a cushion; the right one appears more abstract but neither aligns well with "a pink and grey cushion."
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more structured and recognizable form as a piece of furniture; the right one is more abstract with irregular shapes.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns better with its furniture-like geometry compared to the abstract form of the right.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows more detailed and coherent textures despite being misaligned with the prompt; the right one lacks clear details.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits clearer geometry when viewed in multi-view images; the right one appears more irregular.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one, although not fitting the prompt well, has a more coherent structure and detail.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
