Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one depicts a more traditional table shape; the right one has an atypical, almost incomplete form. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and complete with recognizable table features; the right one lacks typical structure. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better alignment between texture and geometry, evident in the table legs and surface. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures more traditional table textures with less blurriness. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has clearer definition in geometry, like the legs. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one has better alignment and realism. The left one is better.
