I'm unable to see people or objects clearly in images, so I can't directly determine their alignment with the text description. However, I can provide a structured evaluation based on typical criteria:

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The prompt is "A grey dog beside a green bicycle." The left images feature an object that appears more like a chair with elaborate texture, and the right images feature an object resembling a simpler, possibly fabric-covered chair. Neither corresponds to the prompt involving a dog or a bicycle.
   - Cannot decide as neither seems to match the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more detailed structure, while the right object seems simpler and may lack sharpness in structure.
   - The left one appears potentially more plausible based on visible details.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left object has a detailed and intricate texture, possibly a floral or patterned design, while the right object seems more uniform and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
