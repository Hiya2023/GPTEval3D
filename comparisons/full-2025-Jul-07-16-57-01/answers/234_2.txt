Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The object appears more like a bowl, not a vase. It doesn't have the white color with golden patterns described in the prompt.
   - Right (object 2): Similarly, this object also looks like a bowl instead of a vase. It features a yellowish color, but still lacks the white color with golden patterns specified.

Neither object accurately reflects the text description of "a white vase with golden patterns," since both fail to capture the shape, color, and pattern elements of the prompt.

Cannot decide.

Final answer:
3
