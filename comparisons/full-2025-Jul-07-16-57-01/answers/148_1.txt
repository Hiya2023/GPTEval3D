Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model does not resemble a motorcycle; The right model is also not a motorcycle. Both fail to meet the text prompt requirements.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has relatively consistent proportions; The right model has irregular features. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture partly aligns with its geometry; The right model has mismatched textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are less detailed; The right model has clearer textures despite being incorrect for the prompt.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more defined geometry details; The right model's geometry is less clear.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the prompt mismatch, texture alignment, and geometry, the left one performs marginally better.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1 2 1 1
