I'm unable to directly compare these images to the text prompt provided since they don't depict a grey dog beside a green bicycle. However, I can still evaluate and compare the two 3D objects using the criteria specified.

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - The left model appears to be a floral-patterned chair with curved legs.
   - The right model looks like a simple, blue office chair.
   - Neither model aligns with the text prompt "A grey dog beside a green bicycle."
   - **Cannot decide.**

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - The left model appears detailed and fully formed as a chair with realistic curvature and texture details, although floral patterns on chairs are less common.
   - The right model also appears structurally sound as a simple office chair, with standard wheels and shape.
   - Both models are plausible in their existence as chairs, but the left model has more detailed features.
   - **Left (object 1) is better.**

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - The left model showcases intricate patterns and detailed texturing on the fabric, which appears sharp and clear.
   - The right modelâ€™s texture is relatively simple and lacks intricate details.
   - **Left (object 1) is better.**

**Final answer:**
3 1 1
