Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a more complex structure, but doesn't necessarily reflect the description of a simple "white table." The right model is simpler and more closely resembles a basic table shape. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a more elaborate and solid shape, which might not entirely fit a standard table but appears more structured. The right model is simpler and feels more like a real-world table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: In the left model, the textures seem more detailed and aligned with the geometry. The right model's textures align, but are simpler.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model displays more intricate details, while the right model has a simpler, possibly clearer design that suits a basic table.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more complex geometry details, whereas the right model maintains simplicity.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all criteria, the right model better reflects the prompt and has good plausibility as a table.
The right one is better.
