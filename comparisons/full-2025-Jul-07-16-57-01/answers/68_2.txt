Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one accurately represents a black lamp with clear details and shape; the right one is less defined and lacks clear lamp attributes.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears solid and structured; the right one is less plausible with unclear and irregular shapes.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has aligned textures and geometry, maintaining the lamp structure; the right one lacks this alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows clear textures with distinct lamp features; the right one is blurry and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one presents organized and smooth geometry; the right one shows noise and irregularity.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more accurate, solid, and detailed.
The left one is better.
