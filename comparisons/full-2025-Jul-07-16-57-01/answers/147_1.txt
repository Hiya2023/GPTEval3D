I'm unable to see or evaluate the images directly. However, I can guide you on how to assess the images based on the provided instructions. 

Here's how you could approach the evaluation:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe how closely it resembles a "yellow cat on a white sofa."
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Describe the resemblance to the text prompt.
   - Decide which one aligns better with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate if it has natural proportions and structures without irregularities.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Check for realistic and solid appearance.
   - Decide which one is more plausible as a real-world object.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Examine if the texture corresponds well with the shape.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Evaluate texture-shape alignment.
   - Decide which has better alignment.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Assess the clarity and detail without blurriness.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Check for fine texture details.
   - Decide which captures details more effectively.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate the adequacy of geometry details.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Examine the geometry sophistication.
   - Decide which is more detailed and pleasing.

6. **Overall Decision**:
   - Summarize your findings from the above evaluations.

Since you can see the images, apply this analysis to determine which object aligns best with the criteria described.
