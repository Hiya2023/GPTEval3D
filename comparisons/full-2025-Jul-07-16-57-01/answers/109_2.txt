Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is more aligned with "a white table" due to its monochrome appearance. The right one has color details not matching the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left model has an unusual base but looks more solid; the right model appears more typical for a table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one has texture aligning with geometry better at the base; the right one shows a more consistent structure overall.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one has less specific texture details. The right one shows more texture intricacies, even if they aren't fitting the white color.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one's base shows more intricate geometrical detailing while the right one maintains a classic table shape.
Cannot decide.

6. Overall, the right one displays more realistic and detailed traits, even though the color doesn't match the prompt.
The right one is better.
