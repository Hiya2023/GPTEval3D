Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more abstract and less refined, while the right one clearly resembles a sofa with appropriate proportions and structure. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has an irregular, almost amorphous shape, whereas the right one has clear, defined structure similar to a real sofa. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has inconsistent texture mapping that does not align well with its shape. The right one shows better alignment with the shape and textures fitting the sofa form. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left oneâ€™s textures are less detailed and appear more abstract. The right one captures realistic texture details of a sofa better. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks clear geometric details and structure compared to the right one, which has more refined geometric details mimicking a sofa. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one effectively conveys the concept of a yellow sofa with both structural and textural accuracy. The right one is better.
