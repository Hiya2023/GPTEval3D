Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a table, not a sofa, so it does not align with the prompt. 
   - The right model resembles a vase, also not matching the prompt for a "brown sofa with black stripes."
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model's table form seems plausible and solid.
   - The right model's vase form also appears plausible.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture adheres well to its table form.
   - The right model's texture aligns well with the vase form.
   - Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model shows clear textures aligning with a wooden table.
   - The right model exhibits a smooth ceramic-like texture for the vase.
   - Cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model's normal map details are consistent with a table’s structure.
   - The right model's normal map aligns well with a vase’s shape.
   - Cannot decide.

6. Overall:
   - Both models depict objects differing from the text prompt.
   - Cannot decide.
