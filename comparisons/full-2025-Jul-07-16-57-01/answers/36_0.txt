Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears more rustic and textured, resembling a brown dresser in color and motif. The right object, with its vibrant and more polished look, deviates from the description. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: Both models have solid structures, but the right object's shape and structure are more uniform and stable compared to the left one's somewhat distorted form. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: On the left, the texture does not align well with the surface geometry. The right object's texture aligns better with its consistent geometric structure.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left image lacks clarity, appearing abstract and noisy, whereas the right one is more defined and detailed.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows disorganized and noisy geometry, while the right displays a more organized structure and smooth surface.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: Considering the evaluations above, the right object demonstrates better 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, texture detail, and geometry detail, despite the left's better text alignment.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
