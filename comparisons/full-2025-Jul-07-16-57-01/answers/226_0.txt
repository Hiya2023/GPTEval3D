Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object (object 1) closely resembles a sofa with distinct cushions and a clear sofa shape, and captures the "yellow" aspect well. The right object (object 2) appears more abstract, with a less defined shape and unclear detailing, making it harder to identify as a sofa.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
