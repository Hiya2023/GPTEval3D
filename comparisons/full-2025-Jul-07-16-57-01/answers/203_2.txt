I'm unable to view or analyze images to provide specific comparisons or evaluations. However, I can guide you on how to assess the models based on their alignment with the text prompt: 

1. **Color Accuracy:** Check if the models display a turquoise color prominently, as mentioned in the prompt.

2. **Material Detail:** Verify if brass handles are visibly part of the desk design in each model.

3. **Structural Features:** Ensure the models correctly depict a desk form.

4. **Overall Alignment:** Consider if the objects and possible surroundings (if relevant) contribute to the depiction of the described desk.

After examining each point, you can decide which model aligns better with these criteria or if a decision cannot be made.
