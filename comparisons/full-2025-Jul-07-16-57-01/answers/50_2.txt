I'm unable to directly analyze the images provided, but I can guide you on how to make the evaluations based on the criteria you've outlined. Here's a general approach to evaluating 3D models based on the provided criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Describe how closely its features (such as the color and pattern) match the "white vase with golden patterns" text prompt. 
   - **Right (object 2)**: Similarly, evaluate how well this object aligns with the text prompt.
   - **Decision**: Choose which one better matches the text prompt's description.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Assess the naturalness, solidity, and plausibility of the 3D structure.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Evaluate these aspects similarly for object 2.
   - **Decision**: Decide which model appears more realistic and accurately proportioned.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Check if the texture aligns well with the geometry in both RGB and normal maps.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Perform a similar analysis for object 2.
   - **Decision**: Determine which one has better geometry-texture coherence.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Analyze the clarity and detail in the textures.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Examine how well object 2 captures fine details.
   - **Decision**: Choose the object that better maintains fine texture details.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Evaluate the detail and organization in the normal maps.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Assess the quality of object 2â€™s geometry representation.
   - **Decision**: Select the object with more accurate and appealing geometry details.

6. **Overall**:
   - Summarize all evaluations and decide which object is better considering all criteria.

### Final answer format:
Choose between left, right, or cannot decide for each criterion and summarize like this: "1 2 2 1 1 1".
