I'm unable to assess or provide specific judgments from images directly. However, I can give you a guide on how to evaluate the 3D objects based on the criteria you've provided.

### Analysis Guide:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Compare both objects to see which one more closely resembles a "black vase on a brown table." 
   - Note if any object better captures the color and shape described.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Look for which object seems more natural and realistic. 
   - Identify any abnormal shapes, proportions, or nonsensical structures.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - Compare how well the textures adhere to the shapes in both models.
   - Ensure the texture corresponds well to the geometry, especially in normal maps.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Assess which model captures finer details more effectively.
   - Look for clarity and precision in textures.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - Examine the normal maps for accurate representation of shapes.
   - Check for organized and detailed structure vs. noise.

6. **Overall Preference**:
   - Weigh each criterion and determine which model is more favorable overall.

For a specific decision, please use these guidelines to make an informed choice.
