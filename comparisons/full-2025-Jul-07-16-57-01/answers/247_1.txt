I'm unable to view images, but I can still help with analyzing the aspect of text prompt coherence and asset alignment when you describe the models to me. 

If you provide descriptions of both 3D objects, including their shapes, colors, and other visible attributes, I'll guide you in determining which model better aligns with the text prompt "A brown dresser."

Please share detailed descriptions or characteristics of both objects.
