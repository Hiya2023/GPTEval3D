Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model appears to resemble a table with a simpler design; the right model has a more complex structure that may not convey "white table" as directly. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a more uniform and plausible shape, mimicking a straightforward table structure, whereas the right model has irregularities and an inconsistent form.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows consistent alignment between geometry and texture, but the right model has misaligned textures that don't match the underlying structure.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures texture details more clearly without unnecessary stylization; the right model seems overly complex with less clarity.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents a clean and organized geometry, while the right model exhibits noise and less effective structural detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, based on text prompt alignment, plausibility, and detail level, the left model is superior.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
