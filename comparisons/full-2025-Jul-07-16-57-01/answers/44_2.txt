Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model includes a pedestal base with some texture but not purely white.
   - The right model has a simpler structure with a cleaner appearance that matches "a white table."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has complex shapes that may not be realistic for a table.
   - The right model has a more straightforward and plausible structure for a table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's textures seem to misalign with its complex geometry.
   - The right model's texture is simple and more consistent with its shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model has some unnecessary complexity and colors.
   - The right model, while simple, sticks to the "white table" description.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has some detailed geometry that distracts from being a clean table design.
   - The right model has simpler and more appropriate details for a table.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model corresponds better to all criteria, maintaining simplicity and clarity in alignment with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.
