I'm unable to see the images, but I can provide a guideline based on the provided criteria.

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Evaluate how well each 3D object represents a "black vase on a brown table." Look for color accuracy, shape of the vase, and presence of a table.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Check the structures for natural appearance. Look at proportions, any distortions or unrealistic forms.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Ensure textures align with the geometry. The texture should reflect the shape and vice versa.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Examine fine details like surface texture, shadows, and highlights.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Look for precision in geometry, such as the smoothness of curves and edges.

6. **Overall**: Decide which model satisfies all criteria best.

Based on these guidelines, evaluate and fill in with options:

1. <Left> <Right> <Cannot decide>
2. <Left> <Right> <Cannot decide>
3. <Left> <Right> <Cannot decide>
4. <Left> <Right> <Cannot decide>
5. <Left> <Right> <Cannot decide>
6. <Left> <Right> <Cannot decide> 

Complete the final decision accordingly.
