I'm unable to evaluate specific images, but I can guide you on how to assess and compare these models based on your provided images.

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left**: Describe the elements you see. If it doesn't resemble a yellow cat on a white sofa, it scores low.
   - **Right**: Same as above; describe the elements.
   - Decide which better represents a "yellow cat on a white sofa."

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - **Left**: Consider how natural the model looks. Check for realistic proportions and structures.
   - **Right**: Same as above.
   - Decide which feels more like a solid, plausible 3D object.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - **Left**: Check if textures align with shapes. A mismatch would be a cat texture on a non-cat form.
   - **Right**: Same as above.
   - Determine which has better alignment.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - **Left**: Look for fine detail in textures. Blurriness indicates lower quality.
   - **Right**: Same as above.
   - Decide which captures details better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - **Left**: Examine geometry in normal maps for accuracy and detail.
   - **Right**: Same as above.
   - Determine which has a more refined structure.

6. **Overall**: 
   - Synthesize your evaluations to decide which model excels overall.

### Final Answer:
Use the analysis to complete this section. Example: "1 2 2 1 1 1" based on the better performing model for each criteria.
