I'm unable to view the images, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
   - Evaluate how closely each object resembles "A brown sofa with black stripes". Neither object should appear as a vase. 
   - **Decision:** The object that most accurately captures the description of a brown sofa with black stripes is better.

2. **3D Plausibility:** 
   - Assess which model appears more natural and solid, considering proportions and structure. 
   - **Decision:** The object that seems more realistic as a 3D model of a sofa is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Check alignment between textures and geometry on the surface of the objects. Ensure that texture placement seems natural.
   - **Decision:** The object with better alignment is preferred.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Evaluate the clarity and detail of the textures. Look for sharpness and absence of blurring.
   - **Decision:** The object with more detailed textures is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Inspect the geometry for intricate and clear detailing without noise or abnormalities.
   - **Decision:** The object with better geometric detailing is preferred.

6. **Overall:** 
   - Considering all criteria, decide which object is superior in reflecting the prompt.
   - **Decision:** Summarize based on individual evaluations.

### Final answer:
Replace with the respective decisions from individual criteria. If the evaluations were:
- 1 for Left is better
- 2 for Right is better
- 3 for Cannot decide, then follow the example format like "1 2 1 1 2 1".

Ensure each criteria is judged independently and concisely.
