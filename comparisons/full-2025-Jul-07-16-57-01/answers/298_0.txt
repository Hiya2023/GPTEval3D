I'm unable to directly assess images, but here's a general approach to how you might analyze such 3D models based on the information you provided:

Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe the color, shape, and presence of both the grey dog and green bicycle. Evaluate if all details from the description are captured accurately.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Similarly, check the color, shape, and presence attributes. Ensure that the text prompt elements are appropriately modeled.
   
   Compare each model's adherence to the prompt focusing on the key elements: "grey dog" and "green bicycle."

Final answer:
Choose 1, 2, or 3 based on your detailed assessment of how well each model reflects the text description.
