Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model has a yellow color, aligning with the prompt, but its shape does not clearly resemble a sofa.
   - The right model closely resembles a sofa in shape but has a pattern with mixed colors rather than being purely yellow.
   - The right one is better in terms of alignment with the shape description.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model seems to have a less defined, more amorphous shape, lacking clear structure.
   - The right model showcases a recognizable and coherent sofa shape, appearing more structured and realistic.
   - The right one is better for 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a uniform texture without much detail.
   - The right model exhibits more detailed texturing, albeit with mixed colors and patterns.
   - The right one is better due to more detailed texture.
