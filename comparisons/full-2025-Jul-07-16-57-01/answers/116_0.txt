Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one includes floral patterns that aren't specified in the prompt, while the right one accurately reflects a plain "blue chair."  
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears to have fragmented and unrealistic shapes, whereas the right one has more believable and solid structures.  
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures don't align well with its chaotic geometry, whereas the right one has textures that match its solid chair shape.  
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has overly abstract textures and lacks clarity, while the right one has clear and coherent textures fitting the chair design.  
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits disorganized geometry, while the right one shows more structured and clear details.  
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one consistently reflects the prompt better with more plausible and aligned details.  
The right one is better.

Final answer: 2 2 2 2 2 2
