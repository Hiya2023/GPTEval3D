Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model does not correspond to the description of "A turquoise desk with brass handles"; the right model also does not align with a desk description. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural, while the right model has visible irregularities and less coherence.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has consistent alignment between texture and geometry, while the right model shows discrepancies.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures more detailed textures, while the right model appears more abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has better-defined geometry, while the right model shows more noise and inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria above, the left model is more coherent and detailed.
The left one is better.
