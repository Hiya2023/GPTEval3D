Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (Object 1) appears to be a textured blue chair with some reflective surfaces evident in the multi-view renderings.
   - The right one (Object 2) shows a clearer, more uniformly blue chair with smooth surfaces in alignment with the text description.

The right one (Object 2) is better as it more accurately captures "a blue chair" with a consistent blue color and clearer form.

Final answer:
2
