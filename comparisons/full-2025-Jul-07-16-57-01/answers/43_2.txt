I'm unable to see the specific details of the objects based on the text description provided. The task requires detailed observation of the 3D objects generated from the text prompt, which I can't perform here. Please ensure that the criteria you use to evaluate the models are based on your observations of these objects. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask!
