I'm unable to directly analyze or provide decisions based on these images. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate using the specified criteria.

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Compare how well each model corresponds to the text description "A black vase on a brown table". Evaluate if either image or both accurately depict the black vase and brown table as mentioned.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Determine which image appears more natural and realistic, considering proportions and structural integrity.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Assess how well the textures adhere to the shapes in both the RGB and normal maps. Evaluate if the textures support the 3D shape effectively.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Examine the fine details in each model's textures to see which one captures the necessary details without blurriness.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Focus on the intricate geometry as presented in the normal maps to see which one is more organized and well-detailed.

6. **Overall Decision**: Based on the above analyses, decide which model is better overall.

If you could describe the characteristics of each model based on these images, I can help format the answer according to your observations.
