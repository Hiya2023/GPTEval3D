I'm unable to display the content of the images or make a direct comparison. However, I can guide you through the evaluation process based on the criteria provided:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - **Left Object:** Does it resemble a turquoise desk with brass handles?
   - **Right Object:** Does it resemble a turquoise desk with brass handles?
   - Decide which one better matches the description.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left Object:** Consider the naturalness, solidity, and plausibility from the views.
   - **Right Object:** Consider the naturalness, solidity, and plausibility from the views.
   - Choose the one with more realistic proportions and structures.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - **Left Object:** Check if the texture matches the shape in the RGB and normal images.
   - **Right Object:** Check if the texture matches the shape in the RGB and normal images.
   - Pick the one with better alignment.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - **Left Object:** Evaluate the detail and aesthetic quality in the texture.
   - **Right Object:** Evaluate the detail and aesthetic quality in the texture.
   - Select the one with finer and clearer texture details.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - **Left Object:** Assess the normal maps for shape accuracy and detail.
   - **Right Object:** Assess the normal maps for shape accuracy and detail.
   - Determine which has cleaner and more detailed geometry.

6. **Overall:**
   - Based on the above evaluations, decide which object is better.

Please go through these steps and evaluate the models accordingly.
