I'm unable to directly view the images or their specific content, so I'll guide you on how to approach the analysis based on the given prompt "A turquoise desk with brass handles." 

1. **Identify Colors and Materials**: 
   - Check if the objects exhibit a turquoise color and include brass handles. These are the key elements specified in the text prompt.

2. **Compare the Two Objects**: 
   - **Left model**: Observe if there is any representation of turquoise color and any elements that resemble brass handles.
   - **Right model**: Do the same as above.

3. **Alignment with Text**: 
   - Determine which model better represents all the required attributes of the text prompt.

4. **Make Your Decision**: 
   - If one clearly includes turquoise and brass features more accurately, select that model as better.
   - Use the "Cannot decide" option if both models represent the text with equal accuracy or if neither effectively does.

Since I can't see the images, your observations in line with these steps should help you accurately decide which model is better aligned with the prompt.
