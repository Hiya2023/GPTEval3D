Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object does not resemble a turquoise desk with brass handles, and neither does the right object. Both are vase-like structures and do not align with the prompt. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object looks less natural due to its colors and design, while the right object appears more solid and plausible in its structure, resembling a vase. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture does not align well with geometry, while the right object has texture and geometry that correspond with each other more nicely. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object's details are not well-defined, appearing slightly blurry. The right object captures more intricate details and textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry seems less organized. The right one has a more structured and efficient geometric display. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object is better given its superior 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, and detail representation.
