I'm unable to see or analyze the images directly. However, based on the text prompt "A pink vase on a brown shelf," I can provide guidance on how to assess them.

### Analysis:
1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - **The left (object 1):** Look for whether it represents a pink vase placed on a brown shelf. Check the colors and positioning.
   - **The right (object 2):** Similarly, assess if this object accurately depicts a pink vase on a brown shelf. Ensure both elements of the prompt are clearly represented.

### Recommendations:
- Determine which model more accurately reflects all aspects of the text prompt, considering factors such as color, shape, and composition.
- Follow my outlined steps and decide which one captures the essence and details of the prompt more effectively.

### Final Decision:
Decide between:
1. If the left one (object 1) better represents "A pink vase on a brown shelf."
2. If the right one (object 2) better represents the description.
3. If you are uncertain, choose the third option, but use it sparingly.
