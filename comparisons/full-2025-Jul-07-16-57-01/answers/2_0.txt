Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a simple blue chair as described; the right one has more complex features not mentioned in the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more natural and has realistic proportions; the right one has extra features that look less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture and shape alignment on the left is more cohesive with fewer discrepancies between RGB and normal maps; the right one shows inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures the blue color and shape effectively; the right one has distracting patterns and additional colors.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a clear, simple structure without meaningless noise; the right one has unnecessary complexity.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one closely adheres to the text prompt and maintains better coherence and plausibility.
The left one is better.
