Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): This object captures the overall structure of an armchair but has a very multicolored appearance, which detracts from the "orange" specification in the prompt.
   - Right (object 2): This object has a more vibrant orange hue with a classic armchair structure, aligning well with the text description of an "orange armchair."

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
