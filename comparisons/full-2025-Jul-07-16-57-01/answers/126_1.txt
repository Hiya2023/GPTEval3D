Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a round table, not matching the prompt of a "white table" if the description refers to color and shape. 
   - The right one is a rectangular table with a texture that somewhat reflects a "white table."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has plausible geometry as a round table but deviates from the prompt.
   - The right one appears more natural and plausible as a standard table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has decent alignment but lacks detail in reflecting a common table texture.
   - The right one has a better alignment, showing a consistent texture with its shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one lacks detailed texture, appearing flat with no distinct features.
   - The right one has more texture detail, contributing to its realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has less detail and smoothness in its normal maps.
   - The right one shows more intricate geometry details and appears smoother.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one consistently matched criteria better.
   - The right one is better.
