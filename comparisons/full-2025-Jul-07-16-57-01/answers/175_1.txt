Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears to capture a simple black lamp more accurately, with a clear shape that suggests a lamp; The right one has a more complex, unclear structure that doesn't clearly resemble a lamp.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more natural and plausible, resembling a typical lamp shape; The right one seems to have arbitrary shapes and proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better texture adherence to the lamp geometry, with textures aligning properly with lamp-like structures; The right one has mismatched textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has cleaner and more distinct texture details that align with a lamp aesthetic; The right one has noisy textures that do not represent a lamp well.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one presents a smoother, more organized geometry appropriate for a lamp; The right one has irregular and noisy geometry details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the above criteria, the left one consistently represents a black lamp more accurately with better alignment and details.
The left one is better.
