Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
The left one represents a simple table shape clearly; however, the right one also adheres to the basic structure. Both reflect the description well. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
The left one has a more solid and natural look with smoother lines; the right one has inconsistent lines and less plausible structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
The left one shows good texture alignment with more coherent structure in both RGB and normal images. The right one has mismatched textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
The left one displays finer texture details and less blurriness than the right one.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
The left one presents smoother and more accurate geometry. The right one has irregularities and noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model captures the intended characteristics of a "white table" more effectively.
The left one is better.
