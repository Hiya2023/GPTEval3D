I'm unable to display or analyze the images for you. However, based on your description, here's a structured approach you can use to evaluate the models:

1. **Text Prompt**: Review the given text prompt and list the key attributes to look for (e.g., black vase, brown table).

2. **Asset Alignment**:
    - Look at the shapes: Confirm if each object resembles the described items (e.g., vase shape, table outline).
    - Check the colors: Verify if the colors match those mentioned in the prompt (black for the vase, brown for the table).
    - Consider the context: Ensure the objects are oriented correctly on the table and not floating or positioned incorrectly.

3. **Comparison**:
    - Use the multi-view images to assess each model from different angles.
    - Focus on how accurately each attribute from the prompt is represented in the models.

4. **Decision**: Choose the better model based on your assessment or indicate if you cannot decide.

If you follow this structured evaluation, you will be able to determine which 3D model aligns better with the text prompt.
