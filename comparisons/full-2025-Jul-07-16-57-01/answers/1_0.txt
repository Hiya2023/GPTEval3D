I'm unable to determine which of the objects relates best to the given text prompt, "A yellow cat on a white sofa." The images depict fish rather than the prompt's description of a cat and sofa. Therefore, an accurate analysis cannot be performed given the current context and text prompt mismatch.

Final answer:
3 3 3 3 3 3
