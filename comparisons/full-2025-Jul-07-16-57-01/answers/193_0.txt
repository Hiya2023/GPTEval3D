   - Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture and geometry align well.
   - The right object's stripes are consistent with its geometry.
   - Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has clear textures that are not overly abstract.
   - The right object has distinct textures as well.
   - Cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows well-organized geometry.
   - The right object also has detailed geometry.
   - Cannot decide.
