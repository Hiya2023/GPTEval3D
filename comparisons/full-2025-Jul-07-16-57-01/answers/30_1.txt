Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model represents a yellow sofa with more defined features and clear yellow coloring.
   - The right model is less distinct with a more chaotic color and texture.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks more like a realistic sofa with coherent shapes.
   - The right model looks distorted and less realistic.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left model has textures that align well with its shape.
   - The right model has misaligned textures and shapes.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model shows more refined texture details.
   - The right model's textures appear fuzzy and unclear.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left model presents smoother and more logical geometric structures.
   - The right model is more chaotic with irregular geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, given all the criteria, the left model is consistently superior.
   - The left one is better.
