I'm unable to view the images. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the criteria provided:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - Assess how well each 3D object represents a "brown sofa with black stripes."
   - Look for colors, patterns, and overall alignment with the text description.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Determine which model appears more natural and realistic.
   - Check for any strange proportions, duplicated parts, or incoherent structures.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Ensure the texture aligns with the geometry.
   - A "flower" should match in both texture and shape on the model.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Examine the textures for clarity and detail.
   - Avoid models with overly blurry or abstract textures unless specified.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Look for precise and detailed geometry without excessive noise.

6. **Overall Evaluation:**
   - Combine insights from each criterion to determine which model is better overall.

Ensure to apply these steps on the models you have, then summarize your findings as shown in the output format provided.
