Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one does not resemble a lamp; it seems more like a different object.
   - The right one clearly depicts a lamp with visible features.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object does not represent a realistic lamp and lacks recognizable structure.
   - The right object appears to have a logical structure resembling a lamp.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's textures do not align with a lamp structure.
   - The right object shows a reasonable alignment between texture and lamp geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one appears to lack detail and clarity in texture.
   - The right one captures more detail and better aesthetic as a lamp.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has unclear and disorganized geometry.
   - The right one displays more coherent and lamp-appropriate geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one clearly satisfies all criteria of being a "black lamp."
   - The right one is better.
