Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a complex texture with floral patterns, which distracts from the simple prompt of "A blue chair". 
   - The right object is more straightforward with a focus on blue coloring.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has irregular shapes and structures that appear less chair-like.
   - The right object has a clear structure resembling a chair.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object’s texture doesn’t align well with its geometry.
   - The right object’s texture aligns better with its geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has detailed textures but they are not fitting for a blue chair.
   - The right object has more appropriate and consistent textures.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows noisy and disorganized geometry.
   - The right object has cleaner and more efficient geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the right object better matches the criteria.
   The right one is better.
