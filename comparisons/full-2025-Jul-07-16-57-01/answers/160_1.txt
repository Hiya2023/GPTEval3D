Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model is purple and lacks any desk features, not aligning with the prompt. The right model also does not look like a desk, although it has a turquoise color but lacks brass handles. Neither aligns well with "A turquoise desk with brass handles."
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a consistent vase shape but doesn't represent the given text. The right model also resembles a vase more than a desk, but displays more complex textures and structure.
   Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows smoother integration between texture and shape. The right model has intricate textures that match the complex geometric structure.
   Right (object 2) is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture lacks detail and is relatively plain. The right model offers intricate patterns and color detailing, making it appear richer in texture.
   Right (object 2) is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a smoother and simpler geometry, while the right model shows more detailed geometry, aligning with its textures.
   Right (object 2) is better.

6. Overall, neither model fulfills the original prompt of a "turquoise desk with brass handles," but the right model provides a more intricate and detailed representation.
   Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
