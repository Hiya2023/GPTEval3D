   - The left object is more vibrant and clearly yellow, closely matching the "yellow sofa" description.
   - The right object appears greenish and does not accurately reflect the yellow aspect of the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has a more natural shape for a sofa, with realistic cushions.
   - The right object appears less defined with indistinct features.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object shows better alignment between texture and geometry, with clear, defined structures.
   - The right object has a mismatch between its texture and shape.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures fine details and has a consistent texture.
   - The right object appears noisy and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object exhibits smooth and well-organized geometry.
   - The right object shows irregularities and noise.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left object consistently outperforms the right one in every category.
   - The left one is better.
