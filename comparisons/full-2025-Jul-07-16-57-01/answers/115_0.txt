I'm unable to view or analyze the specific content of the images you uploaded. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate the 3D objects based on the described criteria.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Assess how each model incorporates a yellow cat on a white sofa. Compare which model more accurately reflects these elements and their interactions.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Evaluate the realism of each model. Check for natural proportions of the cat and sofa, and identify any structural anomalies or inconsistencies in both models.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Consider if the textures appropriately follow the structure of the model. Check both the RGB and normal maps to determine which model maintains correct alignment of the textures with the geometric form.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Focus on the clarity and detail of the textures on each model. Determine which model captures fine details and textures that reflect the criteria outlined in the text prompt.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Examine the intricacies of the normal maps and how they represent the form of the objects. Check for smooth transitions and meaningful detail.

6. **Overall**: Based on all the above points, decide which model is a better representation.

### Final Decision:
Summarize your analysis using the criteria and options. This sequential assessment should help determine which model better fulfills the prompt while maintaining artistic and technical coherence.
