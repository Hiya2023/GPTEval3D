I'm unable to view the images directly, but based on the text description you provided ("A brown sofa with black stripes"), neither image of the objects described in text (vases) seems to match a brown sofa with black stripes.

When comparing two 3D models that should represent a brown sofa with black stripes, the key elements to focus on would include:

- Color and pattern: Ensuring the presence of brown with black stripes.
- Shape and texture consistency with a sofa.

Since both objects are vases and not sofas, directly meeting the text prompt's requirements is impossible.

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: Neither object aligns with the text prompt of "A brown sofa with black stripes."

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide based on mismatched subject matter)
