Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more vibrant yellow and detailed texture that could be more fitting for a "yellow sofa"; the right one is simpler in appearance. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one seems to have a more natural and complex shape, while the right one is more basic but might be seen as more stable. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s texture matches its geometry, though somewhat chaotic, while the right one seems more subdued and less dynamic. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has intricate texture details, whereas the right one appears more plain. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows more complexity in geometric details, while the right one is smoother but lacks complexity. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left 3D object captures the text prompt and demonstrates detailed textures and geometry, despite being somewhat chaotic.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
