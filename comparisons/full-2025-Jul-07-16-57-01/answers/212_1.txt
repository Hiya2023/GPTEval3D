Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a rounded, blue chair with a modern design and wooden legs, matching the "blue chair" description closely due to its clear color and form.
   - The right one is also blue but has a more classic design with vertical slats and ornate legs. It captures the color but is less aligned with a simple "blue chair" prompt in terms of modern simplicity.

The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
