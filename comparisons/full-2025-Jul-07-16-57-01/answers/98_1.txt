I'm unable to evaluate the images as you're asking due to my current limitations, but I can guide you on how to assess them based on the criteria you've provided. Here's a structured approach for your own evaluation:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Evaluate both models to see which better reflects "a purple chair with white legs."
   - Check if either model captures the purple color and white legs accurately.
   - Decision: Choose the model that aligns more closely with the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Assess which model appears more natural and solid looking at the multi-view images.
   - Look for any irregularities like odd shapes or parts that donâ€™t make sense.
   - Decision: Pick the model with more realistic and plausible geometry.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - Examine how well the texture maps onto the shape of each model.
   - Ensure that the normal map and RGB map reflect matching structural details.
   - Decision: Select the one with better alignment between geometry and texture.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Focus on the clarity and detail of textures.
   - Avoid models where textures are blurry unless specified otherwise in the prompt.
   - Decision: Choose the model with clearer and more detailed textures.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - Look for well-organized structures in the normal maps.
   - Ensure that details are meaningful and not just noise.
   - Decision: Opt for the model with more intricate and accurate geometry details.

6. **Overall**: 
   - Considering the evaluations above, determine which model is better overall.
   - Decision: Decide based on the criteria which model performs best overall.

### Final Answer:
Provide your decisions in the format: "x x x x x x" (where x is your decision for each criterion).
