Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears more aligned with a "white table" given the basic structure, but lacks clarity; The right one also resembles a table but captures more detail and solidity.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object is less structured and lacks realism; The right object appears more solid and naturally proportioned.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left shows some alignment but appears less coherent; The right object’s texture and geometry are more aligned overall.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object’s texture is less defined; The right object captures finer details and is less blurry.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows less detail; The right object has more intricate and refined geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right object demonstrates better alignment with the prompt, plausibility, texture details, and geometry details.
The right one is better.
