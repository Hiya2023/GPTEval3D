I'm unable to fully view the contents of the 3D objects as mentioned. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the criteria provided.

### Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: Describe how each model corresponds to "A turquoise desk with brass handles". Look for turquoise color and brass details. Decide which one aligns better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Evaluate which model looks more natural in terms of shape and structure. Check for realistic proportions and solid appearance.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Assess if the texture fits the shape and contours of the objects. The RGB and normal maps should match in structure.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Compare the textures for sharpness and detail. Determine which model captures details without being blurry or too abstract.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Examine the normal maps for detailed and organized geometry. Choose the one with efficient and visually pleasing structure.

6. **Overall**: After evaluating all criteria, decide which model is overall better.

### Final Decision:
Based on your observations, fill in the format with your results like "1 2 2 1 1 1" or another combination.
