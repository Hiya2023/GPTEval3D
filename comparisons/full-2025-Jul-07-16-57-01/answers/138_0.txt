Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not resemble a pink and grey cushion and appears more like an abstract object; The right one also does not resemble a cushion but looks closer to a solid object with more distinguishable features.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks solid, identifiable structures and seems irregular; The right one has a more defined structure that appears more natural and plausible as a physical object.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows misaligned texture and geometry, with the surface not matching between the RGB and normal images; The right one has better alignment between the texture and structure, though not entirely resembling a cushion.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears more abstract and lacks clear detail; The right one captures finer details with more clarity and realistic textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has disorganized and unclear geometry; The right one presents smoother, more organized geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria, the right one demonstrates better alignment with the evaluated aspects.
The right one is better.
