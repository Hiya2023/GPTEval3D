Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a bowl with a mix of colors, primarily blue and yellow, with no clear white base or golden patterns.
   - The right one has a predominantly blue and yellow appearance with striped patterns, but again lacks a white base or golden patterns.
   - Neither fully aligns with "A white vase with golden patterns." 
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object's structure seems more like a bowl with an appropriate shape. It looks solid without strange artifacts.
   - The right object is also bowl-shaped and appears plausible but is slightly noisy in texture.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left texture is smoother, but less sharp and detailed.
   - The right one, despite being noisy, has more texture details.
   - The right one is better.
