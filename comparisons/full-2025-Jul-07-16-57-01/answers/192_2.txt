Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one resembles a table with a flat surface and single leg; the right one has a more complex base, less typical for a table. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more natural and solid appearance with a simple structure; the right one appears less stable. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with the geometry, maintaining a consistent shape; the right one has misaligned textures. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures texture details adequately without blur; the right one shows more noise and less coherence. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one maintains smooth and organized geometry; the right one displays unnecessary protrusions and noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one exhibits better adherence to the prompt, plausibility, alignment, texture details, and geometry. The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
