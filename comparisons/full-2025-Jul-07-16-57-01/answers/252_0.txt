I'm unable to directly analyze images to evaluate 3D objects. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the given text prompt: "A red ball under a blue chair."

When comparing the 3D models, consider the following:

1. **Presence of Objects**: Check if both the red ball and blue chair are present in the models.
2. **Color Accuracy**: Ensure the ball is red and the chair is blue.
3. **Spatial Arrangement**: Confirm the ball is positioned under the chair.
4. **Model Details**: Assess how accurately and detailed each object is rendered.

These criteria should help you determine which model better aligns with the prompt. Use these evaluations to choose one of the three options:

1. Left (object 1) is better.
2. Right (object 2) is better.
3. Cannot decide.
