I'm unable to compare or analyze the objects based on the given prompt "A grey dog beside a green bicycle" since the images provided depict chairs. Each image shows a blue office chair from multiple angles, and there are colored normal maps as well.

If you have images relevant to the prompt, you can provide those for evaluation.
