Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one appears to show furniture rather than a cushion, which does not align with the text prompt.
   - The right one seems to have a softer shape that could resemble a cushion, though not clearly pink and grey.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has identifiable furniture shapes, which may seem more structured but irrelevant.
   - The right one has a less conventional shape but is more consistent with a soft object like a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has some misalignment in texture and geometry, especially since it depicts furniture.
   - The right one has better alignment between texture and shape, consistent with a soft surface.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has detailed but irrelevant textures for a cushion.
   - The right one lacks distinct fine details but is closer to the expected aesthetic.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has detailed furniture-like geometry irrelevant to the prompt.
   - The right one, despite lacking fine detail, presents a coherent soft shape.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering the prompt alignment and plausibility, the right one captures the essence of a cushion more suitably.
   - The right one is better.
