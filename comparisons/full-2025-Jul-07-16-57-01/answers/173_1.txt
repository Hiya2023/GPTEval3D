Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model does not resemble a white table, showing incorrect colors and unusual features.
   - The right model does not match the prompt either, with incorrect shapes and colors.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has irregular features and implausible structures.
   - The right model appears more solid and table-like despite its flaws.
   - Right is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model shows poor alignment with inconsistent features.
   - The right model aligns better with its geometry and texture, appearing more cohesive.
   - Right is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model lacks detail and clarity in textures.
   - The right model has clearer textures, although not perfect.
   - Right is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has poorly defined geometry.
   - The right model displays better-defined geometry, though still imperfect.
   - Right is better.

6. Overall:
   - Taking all aspects into consideration, the right model performs better.
   - Right is better.
