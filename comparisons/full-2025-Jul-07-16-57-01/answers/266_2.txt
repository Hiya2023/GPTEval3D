Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: The object appears to be a dog on a circular base, with varied colors similar to a dog's natural fur rather than a purple chair with white legs.
   - **Right (object 2)**: The object is significantly smaller and less detailed, but still resembles a dog rather than a chair.

Both objects do not align well with the prompt of "A purple chair with white legs," as neither resembles a chair. However, the left object exhibits more distinct details and texture.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better for detail, though neither fits the prompt.)
