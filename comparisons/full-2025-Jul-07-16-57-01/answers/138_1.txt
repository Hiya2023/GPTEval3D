Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one does not resemble a cushion and lacks the pink and grey color scheme.
   - The right one also does not resemble a cushion and does not have the correct pink and grey colors.
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has an unnatural and unstable shape.
   - The right one looks more like a piece of furniture but not plausible as a cushion.
   Right is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows poor alignment between geometry and texture.
   - The right one has better alignment but still doesnâ€™t match a cushion.
   Right is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one appears blurry and lacks detail.
   - The right one has more defined texture details.
   Right is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one demonstrates disorganized geometry.
   - The right one is more structured, though still not ideal as a cushion.
   Right is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one, although not matching the prompt, is better in terms of plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, and detail.
   Right is better.
