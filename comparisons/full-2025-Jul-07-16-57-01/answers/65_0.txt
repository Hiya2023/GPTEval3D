I'm unable to evaluate if these objects align with the prompt “A brown sofa with black stripes” since they do not resemble a sofa. They appear to be vases instead.

Let's proceed with the analysis based on the images provided:

### Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: The left and right models both resemble vases, not a sofa as described in the prompt. Therefore, neither corresponds to the text description effectively.
   - Cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility**: The left model has a simpler appearance, while the right model shows detailed textures and shapes. The left model appears more uniformly shaped and natural.
   - Left is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: The left model exhibits consistent texture alignment with its form. On the right, there is more texture complexity, but it does not align as well.
   - Left is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: The left model has a smoother and more cohesive texture, which appears more refined compared to the noisy textures in the right model.
   - Left is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: The right model exhibits more complex geometry details compared to the left, though it seems less organized.
   - Cannot decide.

6. **Overall Evaluation**: Considering all criteria, the left model is more consistent and plausible as a 3D object.
   - Left is better.

### Final answer:
3 1 1 1 3 1
