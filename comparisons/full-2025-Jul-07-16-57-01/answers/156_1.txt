Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has an elongated shape that doesn't resemble a typical table, whereas the right one captures the general shape of a round table better.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears unnatural with a distorted shape, while the right one has a more reasonable and structured silhouette.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows misalignment between the texture and geometry, while the right one has texture and geometry that align more consistently.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one's textures appear more disorganized, whereas the right one maintains more coherent details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has less organized geometry, while the right one exhibits smoother and more precise geometric details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one aligns more accurately with the prompt, is more plausible, and maintains better texture and geometry alignment.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
