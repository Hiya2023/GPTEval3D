I'm unable to identify the images or determine if they match the description "A yellow cat on a white sofa." However, I can help evaluate the images based on visual criteria:

Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   Neither object clearly represents "A yellow cat on a white sofa." This makes direct comparison difficult.
   Cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   The left one seems to have more natural proportions and shapes compared to the right one, which appears distorted.
   The left one is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   The left object's texture seems to adhere more closely to its geometry, providing a cohesive appearance.
   The left one is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   The left model exhibits finer texture details, while the right has more abstract textures.
   The left one is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   The left object has more consistent geometry details; the right one seems less organized.
   The left one is better.

6. **Overall**: 
   The left one performs better in most criteria.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
