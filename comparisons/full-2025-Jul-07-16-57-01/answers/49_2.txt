Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears to have some golden patterns and maintains a white color more closely resembling a vase; the right object has darker tones without distinct gold patterns. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more realistic and solid appearance; the right one seems less defined. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left align well with the geometry, while the right one shows less coherence. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures fine details better than the right, which appears more blurred. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is more detailed and well-organized. The right one has less clarity. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object better meets the criteria across all aspects.
The left one is better.
