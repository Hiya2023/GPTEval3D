I'm unable to display or analyze specific images. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the provided description and task.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - **Left (object 1):** Examine whether the model accurately depicts a pink vase and a brown shelf. Check for correct color, shape, and positioning, ensuring both elements are clearly distinguishable.
   - **Right (object 2):** Similarly, analyze this model for the same attributes: the pink vase and brown shelf. Notice if the depiction matches the described colors and structural alignment.

Based on your observation of how each model captures and represents the text prompt:

- If object 1 better aligns with the text prompt and accurately depicts the required components, then "Left (object 1) is better."
- If object 2 performs better in terms of capturing all described attributes, then "Right (object 2) is better."
- If both appear equally accurate, choose "Cannot decide."

### Final answer:
Please self-assess based on the detailed aspects described and select:

1. Left (object 1) is better
2. Right (object 2) is better
3. Cannot decide
