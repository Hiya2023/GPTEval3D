Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) is a spherical shape featuring both blue and yellow colors in intricate patterns. However, it looks more like a textured globe rather than a bowl.
   - The right one (object 2) is a round bowl-like object that also incorporates blue and yellow colors, and its form more closely resembles a bowl.

The right one is better, as it aligns with the "bowl" aspect of the prompt more effectively.

Final answer:
