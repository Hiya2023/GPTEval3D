Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model doesn't resemble a sofa; the right model has a pattern but is still not a sofa. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model is more solid but lacks detail related to a sofa; the right model has a detailed texture but is not plausible as a sofa.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows some alignment with its sheen; the right model's stripes align better with geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has very little detail; the right model captures more texture details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model is smooth without much detail; the right model has more intricate geometric details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the prompt details and 3D model qualities, the right one is more developed, yet neither aligns well with the description.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
