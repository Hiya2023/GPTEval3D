Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear car shape with exaggerated features like large headlights and a visible roof pattern, which may add unnecessary detail that was not specified in the prompt. However, the overall form is distinctly car-like.
   - The right one maintains a simpler and more streamlined car shape, aligning closely with the basic description of "a red car" without additional embellishments. It adheres more strictly to the prompt.

The right one is better.
