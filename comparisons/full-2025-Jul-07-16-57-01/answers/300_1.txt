Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a classic car which aligns well with the prompt "red car" in terms of basic shape and color.
   - The right one also depicts a red car with a more modern look and maintains the overall form expected from the prompt.
   - Cannot decide. Both align with the text prompt adequately.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has some noise and artifact issues but maintains a recognizable car shape.
   - The right one appears more solid and plausible with fewer structural issues.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has some texture and detail but appears noisy.
   - The right one has sharper, cleaner textures with more realistic details.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
