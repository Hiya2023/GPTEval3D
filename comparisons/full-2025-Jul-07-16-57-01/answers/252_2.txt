I'm unable to make an accurate comparison because I can't visualize the images. However, I can guide you on how to analyze them.

### Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Compare the colors, shapes, and positions of items in both objects. The prompt is "A red ball under a blue chair."
   - Look for the presence and accuracy of a red ball and a blue chair.
   - Evaluate which models better represent the specified attributes: color, size, and spatial arrangement.

Based on your observations, decide which model better fulfills the criteria.

### Final answer:
1 / 2 / 3
