Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): This appears to be a bicycle with consistent features and an appropriate size across views. It does not match the description "A purple chair with white legs."
   - Right (object 2): Similarly, this appears to be a bicycle, oriented and proportioned similarly to the left object. This does not align with the description either.

Neither object matches the text prompt description of "A purple chair with white legs."

Final answer:
3
