Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears dark and does not match the description of a "white table," while the right object is closer to a white color. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears less realistic with indistinct shapes, whereas the right model has clearer, more defined proportions. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object has misaligned textures with its geometry, while the right object presents a better correspondence between the texture and the geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model appears blurry and dark, lacking detail. The right model shows more refined textures and color details. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a less coherent structure; the right one shows more defined and smooth geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model aligns better with the text prompt and exhibits more realistic and coherent features.
