I'm unable to directly interpret images, but I can guide you on how to evaluate the 3D objects using the provided text prompt. 

Analyze the objects based on:

1. **Color Matching**: Check if the primary color of the desks is turquoise.
2. **Detail Accuracy**: Look for brass handles or elements that resemble them.
3. **Overall Shape and Style**: Evaluate if the objects fit the typical depiction of a desk.

In general, review each model's entire structure and compare it with the description.

If you went through each model following this guidance, you could determine:

- Which desk looks more turquoise.
- Which includes brass handles clearly.
- Which aligns best with the description of a desk.

After evaluation, choose:

1. Left (object 1) is better;
2. Right (object 2) is better;
3. Cannot decide. 

Then you can conclude with your final choice.
