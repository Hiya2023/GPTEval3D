Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model does not resemble a white vase with golden patterns; it looks more like a dark bowl.
   - The right model has bright patterns and some gold tones, matching the prompt description of a "white vase with golden patterns."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears bland with missing visual details required for plausibility.
   - The right model has more defined structure and looks more like a plausible 3D object.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model’s texture does not align well with its geometry.
   - The right model’s textures match its form adequately, with visible patterns aligned with its shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model lacks detailed textures.
   - The right model has more intricate textures and patterns in the RGB images.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model shows less refinement in terms of geometry detail.
   - The right model presents more detailed geometric structures in the normal maps.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model aligns better with the prompt and demonstrates superior texture and geometric details.
   - The right one is better.
