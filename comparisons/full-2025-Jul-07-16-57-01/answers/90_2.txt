I'm unable to assess these images due to the inability to view or interpret them directly. However, I can guide you on how to analyze the images based on the criteria provided. Here's a breakdown of how to evaluate each aspect:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - Check if both models depict a "yellow cat on a white sofa."
   - Assess which model more accurately includes and aligns the object (cat) with its surroundings (sofa).
   - Look for the presence and correct coloration of both elements.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Consider if the overall shape, size, and positioning seem natural and plausible.
   - Examine for any distortions, unnatural proportions, or duplicated parts.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Assess if the textures applied follow the natural contours of the 3D object.
   - Ensure the texture appears consistent with the surfaces and shapes in the normal images.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Review the sharpness and clarity of textures.
   - Determine which model provides more detail without blurriness or artefacts.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Evaluate the precision in modeling the detailed shapes shown in the normal maps.
   - Check for smoothness and complexity where appropriate.

6. **Overall Decision:**
   - Weigh all observations to determine which model more effectively realizes the given text prompt and exhibits a higher level of technical and aesthetic quality.

Based on your assessments, you'll provide a concise conclusion for each criterion and an overall decision.
