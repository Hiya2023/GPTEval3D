Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more elaborate base but diverges from the standard table concept; the right one looks more like a simple table. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has complex details, while the right one appears cleaner and more stable. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has inconsistent textures across its complex shape; the right one shows better alignment. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears more detailed, though slightly noisy; the right one is simpler. Cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has additional geometric details, but the right one presents a more streamlined and coherent shape. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one aligns more with a practical interpretation of "a white table," offering stability and simplicity. The right one is better.

Final answer:
