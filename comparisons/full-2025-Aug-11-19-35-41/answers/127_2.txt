The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more uniform and solid, with natural proportions, whereas the right model has a slightly exaggerated floral relief, which may seem less natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left vase's texture aligns well with the vase's shape, maintaining a consistent look. The right vase has prominent 3D floral textures that align well with the surface detail.
Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left vase's textures appear clear and detailed but somewhat simplistic. The right vase incorporates intricate floral details and depth, aligning better with the vintage Chinese theme.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left vase shows smooth geometry, while the right vase displays more intricate 3D relief, capturing the floral details better.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all aspects, the right vase better captures the essence of a vintage Chinese vase with detailed textures and alignment.
The right one is better.
