Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: Both models feature a rug and a lamp; however, the left object has a texture that resembles patterns typically seen in Persian rugs more than the right, and the right lamp design looks more contemporary. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model presents more natural proportions and structure; the rug and lamp appear more realistic. The right model has some distortion issues. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better alignment between the RGB image and its normal map, particularly on the lamp structure. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer texture details on the rug, maintaining clarity and aesthetic value. The right is more blurred. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more detailed and coherent geometry in the normal map. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model consistently shows superiority across all evaluation criteria. The left one is better.
