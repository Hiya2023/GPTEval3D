Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a textured appearance, but lacks clear floral engravings; the right one clearly shows floral engravings and a more traditional vase shape that matches the prompt better.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less natural due to its irregular texture and shape; the right one looks more solid and plausible as a realistic vase.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows misalignment in texture and structure; the right one’s texture aligns better with its geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one’s texture is more abstract and less clear; the right one captures more fine details and is less blurry.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is noisy and lacks clear shape details; the right one shows more organized and smooth geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one aligns better with the prompt, is more plausible, and has superior detail in texture and geometry.
The right one is better.


Final answer:
