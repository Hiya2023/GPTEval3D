2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has natural teapot proportions, while the right one appears slightly distorted in shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a detailed and consistent alignment of texture to geometry; the right one lacks this detailed alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one exhibits clear, intricate designs; the right one appears less detailed and slightly blurry.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has more defined and intricate geometric details, while the right one seems to have a smoother, less detailed geometry.
