   - The right one has irregularities and seems chaotic.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture aligns well with its geometric shape.
   - The right one’s alignment appears off, with textures not matching the geometry perfectly.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one shows clear and detailed texture, capturing the refined look of a vintage vase.
   - The right one’s texture looks messy and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has a well-defined geometric structure, with smooth surfaces and clarity.
   - The right one shows more noise and less detailed geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left one is better.
