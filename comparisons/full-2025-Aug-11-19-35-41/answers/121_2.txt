Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a dress with vibrant colors but lacks a teapot; the right one shows a dress and possibly a teapot structure more clearly. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has vibrant colors but unrealistic shapes, while the right one maintains more realistic dress shapes. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s textures don’t align well with the geometry, whereas the right one achieves better alignment. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has vibrant but unclear textures; the right shows more detail and clarity in texture. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left has less defined geometry in normal maps, while the right has better definition and structure. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one is more consistent and detailed across criteria. The right one is better.
