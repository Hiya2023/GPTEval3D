Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more authentic appearance with a classic shape and subtle texture, fitting the "vintage Chinese vase" description.
   - The right one has distinct floral patterns, aligning closely with traditional Chinese aesthetics.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has a consistent shape and natural appearance.
   - The right one maintains a solid structure with clear patterns.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one shows good alignment between texture and geometry with consistent coloring.
   - The right one aligns well but could have minor discrepancies.
   - Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one captures intricate aging and patina details.
   - The right one features clear, detailed floral patterns.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one showcases smooth, realistic curvature.
   - The right one has a slight edge in showcasing ornate textures.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

6. Overall: 
   - Both models have distinct strengths, but the right model better captures the aesthetic details expected of a "vintage Chinese vase" through its textures and patterns. 
   - Right (object 2) is better.
