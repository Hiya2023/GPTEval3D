Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a more vintage and intricate design, fitting the "vintage French teapot with intricate designs" description better. The right model lacks intricate features and looks more generic.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural, while the right model has proportions that seem slightly off, especially in the handle and spout.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better coherence between the RGB and normal maps, with textures lining up with the geometry. The right model displays some mismatches.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures intricate textures, maintaining clarity without blur. The textures on the right model are less detailed and a bit flat.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents more detailed and smooth geometry without noise, while the right model has some irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, given all factors, the left model consistently performs better in alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometric details.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
