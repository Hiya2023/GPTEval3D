Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features more intricate and distinct designs consistent with the "vintage French teapot" description. The right model's texturing is less defined. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural, with clear features and appropriate proportions. The right model seems less defined and less realistic.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better alignment between texture and geometry, with details that are consistent across RGB and normal images. The right model lacks this consistency.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details more effectively, showing intricate design without blur. The right model has a more generic texture.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits more organized and detailed geometry, matching the expected intricacy. The right model appears smoother and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model is more consistent, detailed, and representative of the described teapot.
   The left one is better.
