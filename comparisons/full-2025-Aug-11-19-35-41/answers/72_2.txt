2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and has consistent proportions.
   - The right one is also well-proportioned with no obvious irregularities.
   Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows good alignment between texture and shape.
   - The right one also has good alignment, particularly with its detailed patterns.
   Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has subdued texture details appropriate for a vintage look.
   - The right one has vibrant, clear details that enhance its visual appeal.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one lacks intricate geometry details, giving a smooth finish.
   - The right one includes more complex geometry that adds to its intricacy.
