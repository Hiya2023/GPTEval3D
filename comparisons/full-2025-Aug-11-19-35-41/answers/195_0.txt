2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has more fluid and natural proportions, while the right one appears slightly stiff but still maintains a realistic shape.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its shape, but the right model's detailed texture better adheres to the dress structures.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture is bold but lacks intricacy, while the right one shows detailed and refined textures.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model appears smooth and consistent, but the right model exhibits detailed and intricate geometry.
