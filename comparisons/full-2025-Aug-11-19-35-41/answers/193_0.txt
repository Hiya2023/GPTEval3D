Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a simple design with fewer elements; the right one includes both a teapot and a complex surrounding, matching the "contemporary Chinese teapot on a traditional Persian table" description more closely.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and realistic despite its simplicity; the right one shows irregularities in shape and structure, making it less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with its simple shape; the right one exhibits discrepancies between texture and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has simpler textures; the right one captures fine details that align with the aesthetic described in the prompt.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is basic and lacks intricate details; the right one, despite its complexity, shows more detailed geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment to the text prompt, texture richness, and geometry details:
The right one is better.

Final answer:
