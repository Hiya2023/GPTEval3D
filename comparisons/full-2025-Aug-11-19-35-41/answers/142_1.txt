Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one doesn't clearly depict a table setting, missing the distinctive wooden table aspect.
   - The right one better captures the teapot but similarly lacks the table setting.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model appears less natural with potential irregularities in shape.
   - The right one appears more consistent and solid as a teapot form.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left texture does not align well with the geometry.
   - The right model shows better alignment between texture and shape.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model looks less detailed and somewhat blurred.
   - The right offers sharper and clearer texture detail.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left demonstrates less clear geometry in the normal map.
   - The right one shows more organized and efficient geometry.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right model is preferred.
   - Right (object 2) is better.
