Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model shows a vibrant dress, but no teapot is visible; the right model also shows a dress but lacks any teapot. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a more natural dress shape and proportion; the right model appears less realistic.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model’s textures align with its shape; the right model’s textures do not correspond well to its structure.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clearer and more detailed textures; the right model appears blurry.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's normal maps show more defined dress details; the right model is less detailed.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model scores better in 3D plausibility, texture alignment, texture details, and geometry details. 
The left one is better.
