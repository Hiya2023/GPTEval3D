Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a teapot set on a table, more closely aligning with the prompt. The right one shows an object that more closely resembles a table with objects but lacks clarity on the teapot aspect.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left model appears more natural and solid with clear teapot structures. The right model has an unusual shape that lacks recognizable features.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left model's textures align well with the teapot shapes. The right model's textures do not match the expected forms.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left model captures fine details such as the teapot's surface, while the right is less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left model has well-defined geometry for the teapot, while the right lacks distinct shapes.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment with the prompt, natural appearance, and detail accuracy.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
