Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - The left object accurately depicts a vintage Chinese vase with appropriate colors and floral patterns.
   - The right object also depicts a vase but has a less traditional color scheme.
   - The left one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - The left object has a more realistic and natural structure for a vase.
   - The right object appears less natural due to its exaggerated texture.
   - The left one is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - The left object shows good alignment between the vase shape and its floral textures.
   - The right object has mismatched textures that do not align well with the geometric surface.
   - The left one is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - The left object has fine details with clear floral patterns.
   - The right object appears more abstract and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - The left object has a smooth and clear geometric texture relevant to a vase.
   - The right object's geometry is overly textured and noisy.
   - The left one is better.

6. **Overall**: 
   - The left object consistently aligns with the description, appears plausible, and exhibits detailed textures and geometry.
   - The left one is better.
