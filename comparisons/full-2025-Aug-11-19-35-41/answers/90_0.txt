Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model portrays a teapot clearly, while the right model appears more like a table setting. The left model captures the rustic teapot aspect better.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model maintains a recognizable teapot shape, while the right model’s structure is more abstract and less plausible as a teapot.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model’s texture aligns well with the teapot shape, while the right model lacks clear alignment between the geometry and texture.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures more detail and appears less blurry, making it visually clearer.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more organized geometry without unnecessary noise, while the right model is less defined.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all the criteria, the left model better represents the text prompt and maintains better visual and structural coherence.
   The left one is better.
