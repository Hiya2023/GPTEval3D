Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model includes a lamp with visible details, while the right model lacks a lamp and rug entirely. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model's lamp appears more natural and solid, while the right one lacks complex structures. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's lamp texture adheres well to its shape, while the right model shows basic coloring without texture. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine textures on the lamp. The right model's texture is uniform and lacks detail. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows detailed lamp structures in the normal map. The right model is simple and less detailed. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more comprehensive, detailed, and aligned with the description. The left one is better.
