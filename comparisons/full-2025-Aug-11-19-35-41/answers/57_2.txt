Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a floral arrangement rather than a rug, and the right one features a lamp which matches the description. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears inconsistent with overall proportions; the right one shows a more coherent structure with proper lamp proportions. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a mismatch between texture and geometry, while the right one has better alignment with textures matching the lamp shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one's texture appears busy and incoherent, whereas the right one has clear details fitting the lamp aesthetic. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry is confusing and not well-defined; the right one shows more refined geometry that matches a lamp structure. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right one fulfills the prompt and maintains coherence in both structure and texture.
The right one is better.
