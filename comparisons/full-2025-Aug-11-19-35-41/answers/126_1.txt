   - The right object also displays a colorful pattern but with less contrast and complexity.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object maintains consistent proportions and features typical of an African mask.
   - The right object has more irregularities and less recognizable structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture closely follows the contours of the mask shape.
   - The right object seems to lack cohesion between texture and geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object exhibits clearer and more detailed features on the mask.
   - The right object appears more abstract and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has a smooth and well-defined structure in the normal map.
   - The right object shows some noise and lacks the same clarity.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the left object consistently provides a better representation.
   - The left one is better.
