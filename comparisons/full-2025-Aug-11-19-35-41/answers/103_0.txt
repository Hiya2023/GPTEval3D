Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears more aligned with the description of a "contemporary Chinese teapot" due to its shape, while the right object effectively represents a teapot on a "traditional Persian table" with the visible table surface. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a solid and plausible teapot shape, but lacks the context of a table. The right object looks more complete and plausible as it includes both a teapot and table. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures and geometry seem less cohesive, whereas the right one maintains consistent alignment between the texture and shape, especially on the teapot and table. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right object boasts clearer texture details on both the teapot and the table. The left one has less distinctiveness. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The right object exhibits more detailed and accurate geometry, especially in the table and teapot features. The left one lacks this level of detail. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object consistently matches the prompt and excels in detail and plausibility. The right one is better.
