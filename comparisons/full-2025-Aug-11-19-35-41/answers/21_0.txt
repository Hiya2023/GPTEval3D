I'm unable to provide a final answer without performing the detailed analysis, since I cannot view the images. However, I can guide you on how you might proceed using the criteria described.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
    - Describe how well each model reflects the "contemporary Chinese teapot" and the "traditional Persian table."
    - Look for both object representation and design aspects.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
    - Evaluate how natural and solid each model looks.
    - Consider proportions and structures for both objects.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
    - Check alignment of textures with shapes locally.
    - Each component should appear coherent and consistent across RGB and normals.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
    - Inspect fine details on the textures.
    - Consider clarity, detail, and how well it aligns with the description.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
    - Look for organized and detailed representations in the normal maps.
    - Avoid models with excessive noise or unrealistic structures.

6. **Overall Decision**: 
    - Based on the above evaluations, summarize which model is better.

### Example Output:
The final decision based on your observations might be expressed as:

```
Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one xxxx; The right one xxxx;
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

6. Overall: Based on the above evaluations, xxxx
The left/right one is better or cannot decide.

Final answer:
x x x x x x
```
Each `xxxx` should be replaced with your analysis based on visual assessments.
