2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - The left vase appears colorful and artistic, but the bright background may detract from its realism.
   - The right vase's coloration and shadowing give it a more solid, plausible 3D presence.
   - **The right one is better.**

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - The left vase's textures are colorful but do not enhance its geometry in a realistic manner.
   - The right vase shows a good match between texture and geometry with aligned floral elements.
   - **The right one is better.**

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:** 
   - The left vase has vibrant yet somewhat overwhelming details that might distract from its vintage feel.
   - The right vase presents detailed textures in a subtler, more refined manner, better aligning with the vintage theme.
   - **The right one is better.**

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:** 
   - The left vase seems less defined in its physical shape and detail.
   - The right vase exhibits clearer, more coherent geometry with intricate elements fitting the description.
