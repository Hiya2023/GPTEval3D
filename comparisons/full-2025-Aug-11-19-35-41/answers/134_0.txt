Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has a dark green color with floral patterns, which aligns with a traditional Chinese aesthetic.
   - The right model is colorful and has an ornate design that also fits the vintage Chinese vase description.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and natural in shape, with consistent proportions.
   - The right model looks somewhat fragmented, particularly in the smaller detached part.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - In the left model, the texture and geometry align well, representing a cohesive structure.
   - The right model has some misalignment, especially where elements do not correspond geometrically.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model has clear and detailed floral patterns.
   - The right model, while intricate, appears less defined.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left normal maps show smooth and clear contours.
   - The right model shows irregularities and disconnected parts.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering the criteria, the left model is more consistent with prompt and overall construction.
   The left one is better.
