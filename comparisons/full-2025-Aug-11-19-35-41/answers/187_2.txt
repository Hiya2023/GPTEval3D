Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model appears vibrant and unique but not necessarily aligned with the elegance typically associated with a French evening gown. The right model exhibits a classic gown design with gold-like texture which reflects elegance more appropriately.  
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has unusual proportions that seem less realistic for an elegant gown. The right model maintains more natural proportions and draping akin to a real gown.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture does not consistently align with the geometry, appearing chaotic. The right model maintains consistent texture placement that aligns well with the dressâ€™s shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture is vivid but lacks the refined details expected of elegant clothing. The right model's texture is more detailed and congruent with a luxurious aesthetic.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more noise and lacks smoothness. The right one shows a more coherent structure with well-defined folds and drape details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model fits the criteria for an 'elegant French evening gown' more accurately.
The right one is better.
