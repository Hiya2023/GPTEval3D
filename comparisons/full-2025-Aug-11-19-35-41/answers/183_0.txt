1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a dark and elegant appearance, fitting the evening gown theme. The right model is a lighter, golden gown. Both capture aspects of elegance, but the right one better aligns with the "elegant French evening gown" description due to its refined and luxurious appearance.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears less natural, with some irregularities in structure. The right model has a more solid and plausible form with accurate proportions and a graceful flow.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has mismatched textures and geometry. The right model's texture aligns well with its geometry, giving a cohesive and realistic appearance.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are somewhat blurry and lack detail. The right model has sharper textures that enhance its elegance.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has less defined geometry details, while the right one shows intricate detailing, especially visible in the gown's flow.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model excels in almost all criteria, capturing the essence of the prompt effectively with superior detail and alignment.
