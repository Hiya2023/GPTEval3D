Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one closely resembles a modern Scandinavian chair with clear, defined features; The right one appears abstract and does not resemble a chair.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks natural and solid with appropriate proportions; The right one lacks clear, plausible structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows aligned geometry and texture, maintaining structure consistently; The right one shows mismatched, abstract forms.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures details expected in a chair with clear surfaces and textures; The right one lacks substantive detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has detailed and organized geometry in the normal map; The right one shows disorganized noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model clearly reflects the intended design of a modern Scandinavian chair more effectively across all criteria.
The left one is better.
