Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object shows a vibrant Indian dress with a detailed texture, while the right focuses more on color intensity but lacks a visible modern teapot. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object displays realistic proportions and a cohesive dress shape. The right one has a more abstract shape, less natural-looking. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object has a harmonious alignment between the dress texture and geometry. The right one lacks clear structure alignment between the texture and form. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures fine textile details without blurriness. The right one appears overly abstract and lacks detail. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows a clearer, more organized structure in normal maps. The right one has less defined geometry details. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object successfully fulfills the criteria with aligned textures, detailed geometry, and realistic presentation. The left one is better.
