Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears natural and plausible as a dress. The right object is plausible as a teapot.
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows good alignment between geometry and texture for the dress. The right object shows good alignment for the teapot.
Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has vibrant texture details for the dress. The right object displays intricate texture on the teapot.
Cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits well-defined dress geometry. The right object shows detailed geometry on the teapot.
Cannot decide.

6. Overall, both objects excel in representing different parts of the prompt, making it difficult to determine a single better model.
Cannot decide.
