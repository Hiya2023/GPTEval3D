Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features varied textures, possibly suggesting a Persian rug. The right one appears uniform, resembling a basic lamp shape. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears complex but less cohesive as a single object. The right one seems solid and plausible as a lamp structure. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left shows varied geometry not necessarily matching its texture; the right's texture and geometry are consistently aligned. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left has richer textures with detailed patterns, while the right has a more simplistic texture. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left's geometry seems erratic and less organized. The right is smoother and more structured. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one aligns better with the prompt in terms of being a coherent contemporary lamp design, while the left, although detailed, lacks cohesion related to the prompt. The right one is better.
