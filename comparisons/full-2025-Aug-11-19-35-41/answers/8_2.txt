1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has an elegant and cohesive look more aligned with a French evening gown, primarily due to its solid color and flowing shape.
   - The right model has vibrant and varied colors that could detract from the elegance.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more natural and solid with smooth, consistent lines.
   - The right model has more irregularities and overly complex textures.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture aligns well with its geometry, offering a natural look.
   - The right model's textures appear disconnected from the underlying shape.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model captures fine details with subtlety and elegance.
   - The right model's textures are busy and less coherent.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has smoother and more organized geometry consistent with the dress's intended shape.
   - The right model shows noisy and inconsistent geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model consistently meets the criteria for elegance, cohesion, and natural appearance.
