Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has vibrant colors but lacks distinct African stylistic elements. The right model has both colorful patterns and more pronounced African mask features.  
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears flatter and less structured. The right model looks more solid and has a defined shape that aligns better with a real mask.  
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's colors and geometry are not well integrated. The right model shows better cohesion between texture and structure.  
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture appears more uniform but less detailed. The right model captures finer details that enhance the overall aesthetic.  
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model lacks intricate details in the geometry. The right model has more defined features and structure.  
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right model is superior in alignment with the prompt, plausibility, and detailed execution.  
The right one is better.
