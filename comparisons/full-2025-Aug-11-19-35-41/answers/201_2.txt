Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left model (Object 1) appears to have a fuller skirt and more pronounced structure with contrasting colors, which may align with the description of an “elegant French evening gown” in terms of grandeur.
   - The right model (Object 2) has a more streamlined, elegant silhouette which fits well with the descriptor of elegance typically associated with evening gowns. However, it seems to lack varied coloration, relying more on a uniform green.

The left one has a more striking color contrast and a fuller silhouette which might emphasize elegance more effectively in terms of visual appeal, but the right one has a classic, sleek shape.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
