Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a mismatched color scheme but includes two distinct objects; however, it lacks detail on the vase.
   - The right one does not show the vase but has a more elegant gown design.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears less consistent with unnatural textures.
   - The right one has a more coherent and plausible shape.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has some texture misalignment and abstract patterns.
   - The right one’s texture adheres better to the gown’s shape.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has vivid, but overly abstract textures.
   - The right one captures finer, more realistic details.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one exhibits noisy geometric detail.
   - The right one has smoother, more coherent geometry.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering accuracy, plausibility, and detail quality, the right model is better.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
