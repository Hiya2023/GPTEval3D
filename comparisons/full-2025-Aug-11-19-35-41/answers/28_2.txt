   - The right mask has more cohesive and realistic proportions.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left mask has textures that do not align well with the geometry, appearing inconsistent.
   - The right mask has textures that closely match the visible geometric shapes.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left mask's textures are somewhat blurry and less defined.
   - The right mask displays sharp, clear details that are aesthetically pleasing.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left mask exhibits some noise, with less defined geometric features.
   - The right mask shows a well-organized structure with intricate details.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Right is consistently better across all criteria.
