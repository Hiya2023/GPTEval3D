Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one includes a gown with floral patterns and a visible vase, closely aligning with the description.
   - The right one has a similar gown, but the vase is less distinct.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more consistent and natural, with plausible proportions.
   - The right model has some irregularities.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows a more cohesive alignment between textures and shapes in both RGB and normal maps.
   - The right one has less alignment, particularly in the vase.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has clear and detailed patterns on the gown.
   - The right one appears slightly more abstract.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows intricate and well-defined geometry in the normal maps.
   - The right one is less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one provides a better representation of the prompt.
   - The left one is better.
