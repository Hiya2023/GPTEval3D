Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a simple teapot, while the right one displays a detailed teapot on a Persian table with intricate decorative elements. The right one better aligns with the prompt.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one is simple and appears natural, but the right one, despite being more complex, looks functional and reasonable in its 3D context.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has clear texture and shape alignment, but the right one shows better integration of detailed textures and geometry in a complex scene.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks texture details compared to the right one, which exhibits vibrant and intricate details consistent with a Persian table.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is simple, whereas the right one shows complex and well-defined geometric details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model captures the prompt's complexity, details, and alignment better than the left.
The right one is better.
