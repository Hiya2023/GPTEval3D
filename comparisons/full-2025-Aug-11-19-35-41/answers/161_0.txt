   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (Object 1):** Appears unnatural with abnormal textures and proportions.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Looks more realistic and solid.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - **Left (Object 1):** The texture does not align well with the geometry.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The texture aligns better with the gown's shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - **Left (Object 1):** The textures are too abstract and lack detail.
