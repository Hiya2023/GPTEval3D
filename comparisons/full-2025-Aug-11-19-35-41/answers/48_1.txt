Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a gown with less detail indicative of elegance and no vase; the right one represents a gown and no vase. Neither fully captures the description. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has smoother, more plausible proportions; the right one has awkward angles. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows consistency between shape and texture; the right one has misalignments. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears blurry; the right one has more defined textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows smooth detail; the right one has more noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering these aspects, the left one is more consistent in quality and alignment. The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1 2 1 1
