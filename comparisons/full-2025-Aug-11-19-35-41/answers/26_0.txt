The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a solid, natural form with uniform structure. The right model, although detailed, appears less realistic in shape due to excessive embellishments.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model’s textures align well with its smooth surface. The right model's textures are vibrant and adhere to its geometry, although they seem slightly mismatched in some areas due to complexity.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model features more subdued textures with clarity, while the right model’s textures are vibrant and detailed, capturing a vivid design aesthetic.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows a simple, clean structure, whereas the right exhibits complex details in geometry that are visually interesting, though somewhat exaggerated.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the alignment with the prompt, intricate details, and visual appeal, the right model showcases a more compelling representation of a vintage Chinese vase.
The right one is better.
