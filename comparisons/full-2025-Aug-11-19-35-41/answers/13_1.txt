The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more coherent and natural with better proportion and structure. The right one has some irregularities and seems less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left teapot appears to have better alignment between its texture and geometry, while the right one shows some inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures the texture details more sharply, while the right model looks somewhat blurred.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows smoother and more organized geometry, whereas the right one appears disorganized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model excels in covering more criteria effectively.
The left one is better.
