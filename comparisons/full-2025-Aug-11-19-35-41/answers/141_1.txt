Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not include a Japanese vase, and the gown's elegance is less pronounced. The right one features a gown with more intricate details and appears alongside a vase-like object. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks simple and less realistic with basic textures. The right one has a more complex and natural structure, with detailed textures and realistic proportions and surroundings. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures do not align well with its shape, appearing flat. The right object shows texture details that follow the gown's folds and form better. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has low detail textures. The right one captures finer details in the gown's decor, making it visually rich. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is plain with minimal detail. The right one's geometry is well-defined, with detailed structures on the gown. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object better captures the text prompt, plausibility, and details in both texture and geometry. The right one is better.
