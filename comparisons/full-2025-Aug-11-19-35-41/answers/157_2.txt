Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object captures the vibrant Indian dress well, but the right object better illustrates the sleek, modern aspects of the teapot. Overall, the right one includes both elements described.  
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left object appears plausible as an Indian dress, while the right object appears more consistent and natural as a teapot. Both have reasonable proportions, but the right seems more complete.  
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left object shows good alignment for the dress, but the right object displays better texture alignment with the teapot's complex shape.  
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left object has vibrant and clear texture details on the dress, but the right object captures intricate details on the teapot more effectively.  
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left object's dress lacks some intricacy, whereas the right object shows a more detailed and smoother teapot geometry.  
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object provides a more accurate representation of the given text prompt and excels in all the evaluated criteria.  
The right one is better.
