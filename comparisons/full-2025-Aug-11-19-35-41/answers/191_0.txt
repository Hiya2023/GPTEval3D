Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a single rustic teapot, while the right object includes a teapot set on a wooden tray. The right one reflects the text prompt more accurately. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object's proportions look consistent for a teapot, but the right object includes multiple teapots and a tray, adding complexity with more potential for errors. However, both appear plausible in their structures. 
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's surface and geometry align well, but the right object's details like the tray texture align specifically with the geometry. 
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object lacks detailed texture compared to the right object, which shows more complexity and detail in textures such as the wooden tray. 
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The right object shows intricate details in normal maps on the tray and teapots, whereas the left object appears simpler.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object covers more aspects of the prompt and exhibits better detail and texture.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 3 2 2 2 2
