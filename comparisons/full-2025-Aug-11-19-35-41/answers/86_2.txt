Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left only shows a dress, missing the teapot; the right includes both a dress and a teapot.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left dress looks solid but lacks variation. The right dress has more detail and the teapot adds realism.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left dress texture aligns well but lacks complexity. The right shows better detail alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left dress textures are vibrant but repetitive. The right dress is detailed with realistic textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left dress maintains basic structure, but the right dress and teapot show intricate geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one captures both the description and details effectively.
The right one is better.
