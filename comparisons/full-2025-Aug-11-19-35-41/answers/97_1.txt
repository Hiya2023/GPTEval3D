Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one accurately represents a modern Scandinavian chair, capturing the sleek design and wooden materials; the right one has abstract and unclear forms that don't align with the prompt. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears as a plausible chair with realistic proportions and structure; the right one lacks a coherent shape resembling a practical object.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures and geometry align well, providing a cohesive appearance; the right one has mismatched textures and geometry with incongruent structures.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures wood grain details effectively without blurring; the right one has abstract and unclear textures.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows intricate geometry with well-defined structures; the right one lacks clear geometric details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left one comprehensively meets the criteria for a modern Scandinavian chair in terms of alignment, plausibility, and details.
   The left one is better.
