Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more minimalist, consistent with the text prompt, featuring subtle floral engravings. The right one is heavily adorned with floral patterns but lacks the minimalist aspect.  
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a smooth and proportionate form, matching a realistic vase structure. The right one has a more complex shape with pronounced features, which may detract from a natural appearance.  
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left vase shows better alignment where engravings and textures match the vase's shape. The right one seems to have texture mismatches or overlaid details that do not conform well with the geometry.  
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left vase captures fine engravings simply and elegantly. The right one may appear overly detailed and cluttered, deviating from minimalism.  
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left vase maintains a smooth structure with clear engravings, while the right vase's geometry appears more complex and less consistent.  
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left vase better embodies the described characteristics, including minimalism and engraving, while maintaining plausible geometry and texture alignment.  
The left one is better.
