Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - The left model captures a contemporary Chinese teapot on what appears to be a traditional Persian table, though details in texture need attention.
   - The right model shows a teapot but lacks clarity in depicting either a contemporary style or a Persian table.
   - The left one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left model seems more natural and solid, with cohesive proportions.
   - The right model lacks depth and appears poorly distinguished.
   - The left one is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - The left model has more consistent alignment between its texture and geometry.
   - The right model exhibits misalignment and texture blending issues.
   - The left one is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - The left model captures more fine texture details, though slightly blurry.
   - The right model does not clearly depict detailed textures.
   - The left one is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - The left model shows clearer, smoother geometry details without noise.
   - The right model lacks clarity and presents noisy geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. **Overall**:
   - The left model consistently performs better in all criteria.
   - The left one is better.
