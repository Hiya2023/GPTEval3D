   - The right one is colorful and ornate, which does not align with the rustic description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid and plausible with realistic proportions.
   - The right one has some proportion inconsistencies and appears less natural.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture aligns well with its shape, maintaining a consistent appearance.
   - The right one shows misalignment with texture overlay not matching the geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures fine details without appearing blurry, matching the rustic style.
   - The right one is more abstract and does not align with the prompt's simplicity.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has well-defined and smooth geometric details, appropriate for the prompt.
   - The right one contains more noise and lacks smooth detail alignment.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model successfully adheres to the rustic theme, maintains plausibility, and aligns texture and shape more accurately.
