Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows floral patterns and a traditional shape but is less textured; the right one has detailed floral patterns and a more traditional vase shape fitting the "vintage Chinese vase" description closely.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears flatter and less natural, whereas the right one has convincing texture and shape, making it appear more solid and realistic.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows less alignment between geometry and texture; the right one has textures that fit smoothly along its curves and shapes, showing proper alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has simpler, less detailed textures; the right one shows intricate floral designs that resemble detailed ceramic patterns.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows less definition in geometry; the right one demonstrates more refined and detailed geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one offers better alignment with the prompt, more plausible 3D and texture details, and better geometry.
The right one is better.
