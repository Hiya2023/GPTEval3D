Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one blends classic African mask features and abstract art well with distinct patterns and shapes. The right one has a more abstract, colorful interpretation but lacks clear traditional elements. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a solid mask-like appearance with consistent proportions. The right one appears less structured and more abstract, making it less plausible as a real mask.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures align well with the shape and enhance its features, while the right one seems to have texture misalignments, causing distortion.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures fine details clearly, showing distinct patterns without blurring. The right one is more abstract and lacks clear details.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays organized and smooth geometry, while the right one has irregularities and noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one consistently meets the criteria more effectively.
The left one is better.
