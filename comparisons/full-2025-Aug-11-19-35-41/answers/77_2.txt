1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left vase has vibrant colors and intricate floral patterns, fitting the "vintage Chinese vase" description well. The right vase has a classic shape and floral motifs, also aligning with the description. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left vase appears slightly less realistic due to its overly saturated colors and unclear details. The right vase looks more natural and solid, with appropriate proportions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left vase's texture and shape have slight misalignments in places. The right vase's texture aligns better with its geometry, maintaining consistency between RGB and normal maps.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left vase shows distinct patterns but appears somewhat blurred. The right vase captures finer details and has clearer, more precise textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left vase has a smoother but less detailed geometry, while the right one has more intricate and well-organized geometry details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right vase is more consistent and closely fits the criteria.
The right one is better.
