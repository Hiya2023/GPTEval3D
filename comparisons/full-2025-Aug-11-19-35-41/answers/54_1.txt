   - The right one has less pronounced abstract elements and fewer details.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks more like a solid, realistic mask with consistent shape and form.
   - The right one lacks depth and looks more flat.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one shows good alignment between texture and geometry, with intricate patterns matching the surface contours.
   - The right one has less detail alignment between the texture and shape.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one captures fine details effectively with vibrant colors and clear patterns.
   - The right one is more muted and lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
