Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has intricate designs with a vintage look; the right model also features designs but looks plainer. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and has realistic proportions; the right model looks slightly off in shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left align well with the geometry; the right model shows some misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer details without blurring; the right model looks smoother but less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows intricate geometry; the right model is more simplistic.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model better captures the vintage and intricate attributes described in the prompt.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
