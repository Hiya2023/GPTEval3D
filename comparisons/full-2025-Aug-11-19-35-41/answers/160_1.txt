2. 3D Plausibility: 
The left object appears more solid and realistic with natural proportions. The right object has a more complex, less believable structure. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
The left object shows consistent texture and geometry alignment, while the right's design introduces inconsistencies. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
The left object has clear, detailed textures reflective of a rustic aesthetic. The right object appears more abstract and stylized. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
The left object displays smoother, well-organized geometry, while the right has excessive and inconsistent detail.
The left one is better.
