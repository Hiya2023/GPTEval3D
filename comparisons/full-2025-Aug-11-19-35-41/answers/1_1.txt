   - The right one has a more natural and solid appearance.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one shows misalignment between texture and geometry.
   - The right one has a better alignment between the floral engravings and vase geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one appears overly stylized and lacks fine detail.
   - The right one captures finer textures, appearing more realistic.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one has inconsistent and noisy details.
   - The right one presents smoother and more coherent geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one aligns more closely with the prompt and quality expectations.
