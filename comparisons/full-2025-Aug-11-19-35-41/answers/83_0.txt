Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one features bold colors and raised textures, with floral patterns that stand out; the overall appearance is vibrant.
   - The right one has a more traditional appearance with delicate floral motifs, which align more with a vintage Chinese vase.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has exaggerated features that look less realistic.
   - The right one has smoother, more natural proportions.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's raised textures deviate slightly from the vase's form.
   - The right one has textures that smoothly adhere to the vase's shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures bold flower details but seems overly stylized.
   - The right one displays finer, more precise texturing consistent with traditional aesthetics.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one's geometry is overly textured and irregular.
   - The right one has a more consistent and well-defined structure.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Right one has more accurate text prompt alignment, plausibility, alignment, texture, and geometry details.
   - The right one is better.
