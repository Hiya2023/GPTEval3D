1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a more consistent vintage, rustic design, aligning well with "rustic Italian teapot." The right object has floral and geometric patterns that seem less traditionally rustic.  
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a solid, believable structure and consistent proportions. The right object has some irregularities, particularly in the shape and handle, which look less natural.  
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left object closely matches its 3D structure, particularly on the body and lid. The right object has inconsistencies between texture and geometry on the handle and body.  
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures fine details in the patterns without blurring, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. The right object has more abstract textures that appear less precise.  
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's normal map shows intricate detailing that enhances its shape, while the right one displays some noisy, less organized details.  
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left object aligns better with the criteria.  
The left one is better.
