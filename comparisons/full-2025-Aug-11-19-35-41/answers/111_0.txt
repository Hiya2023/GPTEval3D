3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture does not align well with its shape.
   - The right model shows good alignment, as the floral design fits the vase structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's texture appears blurry and lacks detail.
   - The right model captures fine details in its patterning.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has a straightforward and smooth geometry without intricate details.
   - The right model shows more defined and smooth shapes, enhancing realism.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
