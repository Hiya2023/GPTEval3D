The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more vibrant and filled out, suggesting solidity, while the right model looks flat and less defined. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures and geometry align well, especially with the intricate details on the dress. The right model's textures don't align as precisely.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures detailed floral patterns on the gown that match the description. The right model has a more simplistic texture.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model provides intricate and detailed geometry, visible in the normal maps. The right model lacks in comparison. 
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model better captures the essence of the text prompt in all evaluated criteria.
