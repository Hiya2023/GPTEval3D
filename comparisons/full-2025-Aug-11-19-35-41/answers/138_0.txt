I'm unable to compare the objects directly from these images. However, I can provide you with an example of how to structure the analysis. You'll need to carefully observe the details in the images to fill in these sections.

### Example Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: The left one aligns with the prompt by showing a gown, but the absence of a vase affects the alignment; The right one shows a gown but has no indication of a vase either.  
   Cannot decide.

2. **3D Plausibility**: The left one appears more natural with smoother and more plausible proportions; The right one has some unrealistic texture and proportions.
   The left one is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: The left one shows some misalignment with texture not perfectly fitting the gown shape; The right one exhibits better matching shape and texture.
   The right one is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: The left one captures intricate dress patterns with clarity; The right one appears somewhat blurry.
   The left one is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: The left one shows more detailed and realistic geometry; The right one has some noise in its structure.
   The left one is better.

6. **Overall**: Considering all the criteria, the left one is more coherent and close to the desired prompt.  
   The left one is better.

### Final answer:
3 1 2 1 1 1 

Adjust the analysis based on the specific observations you make from the images.
