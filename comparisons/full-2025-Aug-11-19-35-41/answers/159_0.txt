Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is darker and more traditional, not adhering well to the "modern Scandinavian" style.
   - The right one reflects a more modern design with minimalistic features, aligning better with the prompt.
   
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears solid but with traditional shapes that may not reflect modern design concepts.
   - The right one has a more plausible Scandinavian structure with clean lines and proportions.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's textures and shapes are slightly more detailed but misaligned with expected Scandinavian features.
   - The right one shows good alignment between its textures and geometric structure, matching modern design principles.
   
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one has visible texture details but looks less clean and modern.
   - The right one has smoother textures that match a modern aesthetic better.
   
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one shows more intricate detailing but misaligned with the modern design.
   - The right one has a cleaner geometry that fits the Scandinavian style well.
   
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   The right one meets the criteria for a modern Scandinavian chair more effectively. It captures the essence of modern design, with appropriate texture-geometric alignment and plausibility.

The right one is better.
