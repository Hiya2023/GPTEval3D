   - The right model appears more natural and solid.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model has some misalignment between textures and geometry.
   - The right model shows better alignment between textures and the geometry of both objects.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's textures are less detailed and appear slightly blurry.
   - The right model captures finer texture details effectively.
   - The right one is better.
