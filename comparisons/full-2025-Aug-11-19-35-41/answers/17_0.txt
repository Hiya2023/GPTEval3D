1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clear rustic design with a hand-crafted appearance, featuring floral and striped patterns. The right one also has a floral design but appears more modern and elaborate. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a cohesive structure but has somewhat distorted shapes. The right one lacks natural proportions, appearing unrealistic in certain views.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows some misalignment in texture and geometry, especially around the spout. The right one has a well-aligned texture and geometry overall.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one delivers detailed textures but is slightly blurry in some areas. The right one shows clearer and more refined textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits some noise but maintains a rustic aesthetic. The right one presents smoother surfaces with fewer noisy elements.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns more closely with the rustic theme, while the right one excels in technical details.
The left one is better.
