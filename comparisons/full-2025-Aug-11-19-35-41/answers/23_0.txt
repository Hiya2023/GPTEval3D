Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left vase has a smoother and more coherent Asian design with well-integrated patterns. The right vase has more floral details but lacks coherence. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears uniform and solid, resembling a vintage vase. The right model seems less natural with more abstract proportions.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model’s texture follows the vase's shape more naturally. The right model's texture appears misaligned and less integrated.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left vase’s texture is more detailed and refined. The right model has excessive noise and less clarity in details.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows a well-organized structure with smooth transitions. The right model has more irregularities and noise.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model excels in alignment, consistency, and detail.
   The left one is better.
