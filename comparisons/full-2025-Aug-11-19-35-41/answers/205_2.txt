Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1):** The teapot has a contemporary design with intricate patterns and is placed on a saucer, resembling classic Chinese styles. The table's texture cannot be clearly identified as Persian.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The teapot is simpler, with fewer intricate patterns. The focus is more on the shape but lacks specific Chinese characteristics. The table is not clearly identifiable as Persian from the images.

The left one better aligns with the "contemporary Chinese teapot" aspect, but both lack clear indication of a "traditional Persian table."

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
