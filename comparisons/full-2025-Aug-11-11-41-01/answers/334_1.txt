Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is white with visibly defined golden patterns resembling a traditional style.
   - The right one has a more colorful appearance with white and multiple colors. The golden pattern appears more as accents rather than defined shapes.
   - The left one is better aligned with the prompt "A white vase with golden patterns" due to its color and pattern accuracy.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more textured and solid, with consistent shapes and no apparent structural issues.
   - The right one, while colorful, has patterns that might disrupt the perception of solidity and consistency.
   - The left one is more plausible as a 3D model.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a finer texture with more detailed surface patterns.
   - The right one, while colorful, has a smoother and less detailed surface.
   - The left one has sharper, more realistic textures.
