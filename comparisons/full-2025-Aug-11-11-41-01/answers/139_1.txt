3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a good alignment of texture and geometry; The right one seems less synchronized. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures finer details without notable blurriness; The right one is more abstract. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits smoother and more accurate geometry; The right one is less clear and organized. The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all aspects, model on the left displays better proportions, clarity, and alignment with textures. The left one is better.
