Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left (object 1) model depicts a green bicycle accurately in terms of color and general shape. However, it does not include a grey dog. The right (object 2) model features a grey dog accurately on a green base, but lacks the green bicycle. Neither model fully captures both elements described in the text prompt. The bicycle and the dog are placed separately without the required proximity.

Cannot decisively determine which one is better, as each captures one primary component well but not both.

Final answer:
3
