Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object uses a multicolored texture that doesn’t fit the “orange armchair” prompt well. The right object is uniformly orange and fits the description better. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears less solid, with uneven proportions, while the right object appears more natural and consistent with a typical armchair. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture doesn’t align well with its geometry. The right object's texture and geometry are better aligned, maintaining consistency. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object’s texture appears noisy and unclear. The right object captures a more uniform and detailed texture consistent with the description. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows more noisy detail, which detracts from its shape accuracy. The right object has more organized and smooth details. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment, plausibility, and detail, the right object clearly outperforms the left. The right one is better.
