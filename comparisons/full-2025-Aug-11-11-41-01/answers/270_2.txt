Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a pattern that includes multiple colors and does not clearly reflect the text prompt of "brown with black stripes." It doesn't meet the description as it lacks the predominant brown and black colors.
   - The right one is predominantly brown and aligns more accurately with the text prompt, although it doesn't clearly show black stripes. It better captures the brown aspect.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
