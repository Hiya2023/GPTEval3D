Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The object resembles a clear structure with blue and red elements, which does not clearly represent a chair and ball. 
   - Right (object 2): The object clearly depicts a red ball against a blue background, which aligns well with the prompt description of "A red ball under a blue chair".

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
