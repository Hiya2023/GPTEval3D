Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features a consistent pattern of pink and grey that aligns well with the prompt "A pink and grey cushion." The right one, however, introduces floral patterns which deviate from the description. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more cushion-like with a smooth, consistent shape. The right one seems irregular with texture noise detracting from its plausibility.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture and geometry align well; the pattern follows the cushion's curves. In the right one, the texture seems misaligned with its geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays clear and consistent details, with high fidelity to the design. The right oneâ€™s details are unclear and noisy.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has accurate and smooth geometry, resembling a cushion. The right one has less defined geometry and appears noisy.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering the alignment with the text prompt, plausibility, texture alignment, and detail clarity, the left one is more successful.
The left one is better.
