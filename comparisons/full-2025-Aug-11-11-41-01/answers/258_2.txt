Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) is a yellow sofa but includes other colors and patterns, which might not perfectly align with the simplicity of the text prompt.
   - The right one (object 2) is a yellow sofa with a floral pattern, aligning well with the prompt due to its more uniform yellow color and sofa-like shape.
   
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
