Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a smooth, clear vase shape with golden patterns that follow a simple, cohesive design, matching the prompt of "A white vase with golden patterns."
   - The right one has a more complex and fragmented surface with scattered golden patterns which may not align as closely with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears to have a more solid and regular shape, typical of a vase, with no apparent structural issues.
   - The right one has an irregular, fragmented design that may appear less plausible as a cohesive 3D model, with potential duplication and noise.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one features clear and distinct golden patterns against a clean white surface.
   - The right one has a more mottled appearance with less distinct texturing.
   - The left one is better.
