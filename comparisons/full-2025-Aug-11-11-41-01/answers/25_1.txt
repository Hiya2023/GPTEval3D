Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left object has a darker base color with patterns and seems less aligned with "pink vase on a brown shelf."
   - The right object is bright pink and stands out more against the suggested color backdrop.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has more abrupt and unnatural pattern transitions.
   - The right object appears more consistent and smooth in shape, matching typical vase geometry.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object shows misalignment with the texture and geometry.
   - The right object's texture aligns well with its geometry, maintaining smooth transitions.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has busy and less detailed textures.
   - The right object has clearer patterns and textures.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows irregularities in the normal map.
   - The right object has more consistent normal map details reflecting the vase shape.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one consistently meets the criteria better across all aspects.
   - The right one is better.
