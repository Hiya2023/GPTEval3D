Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model is blue and resembles a chair, capturing the "blue chair" prompt well.
   - The right model also resembles a chair and includes blue but has multiple colors.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks structurally solid and believable as a chair.
   - The right model appears distorted and less plausible due to disproportionate features.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model shows good alignment between geometry and texture; both the RGB and normals suggest a cohesive structure.
   - The right model has mismatched geometry and texture, with the texture not aligning well.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model captures fine texture details more effectively.
   - The right model appears to display noisy and less coherent textures.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model presents clear, detailed geometry in the normal maps.
   - The right model shows irregular and disorganized geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model consistently performs better across all criteria.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
