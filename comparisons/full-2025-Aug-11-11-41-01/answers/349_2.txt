Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one is a green car which does not match the “red car” prompt; the right one fails to form a car shape and lacks color clarity. The left one is better because it resembles a car, although the color is incorrect.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more like a plausible car structure. The right one lacks a defined car shape, making it less plausible. The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has more detailed texture with recognizable car parts, while the right one lacks clear details. The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1
