Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one appears as a textured sphere with red and blue patterns, but it does not clearly represent a red ball under a blue chair.
   - The right one is a plain blue sphere, potentially representing the blue chair as a single object without the red ball.
   - The right one is better as it more closely resembles a ball, though neither truly fulfills the prompt completely.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a complex texture that may look strange and less plausible compared to a simple ball structure.
   - The right one appears more normal, solid, and plausible as a basic spherical object.
   - The right one is better due to its simple and plausible form.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed textures with different patterns, though it might seem noisy.
   - The right one has a smooth texture but lacks detailed features.
   - The left one is better due to detailed textures, even if they're imperfect.
