Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears as a traditional sofa with a blend of colors, primarily blue with hints of yellow. It doesn't fully capture the "yellow sofa" prompt due to the dominant blue.
   - The right one is a corner sofa and predominantly yellow, matching the text prompt more accurately.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
