Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is multicolored and not orange, while the right one is clearly orange and resembles an armchair.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has an unrealistic appearance due to its color pattern, while the right one looks more plausible as an armchair.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture does not align well with its geometry due to the abstract colors, while the right one's texture better matches its shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks clarity in texture, whereas the right one shows finer detail despite slight blurring.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry appears noisy, while the right one shows a more organized structure aligned with an armchair.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one better represents the prompt.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
