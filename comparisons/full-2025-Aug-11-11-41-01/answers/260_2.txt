Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (object 1): The model is a brown dresser with a classic silhouette and three drawers, matching the description well. The texture appears rough, and the structure is reasonably clear.
   - Right (object 2): The model is also a brown dresser but has a more ornate and polished appearance. It is glossier and more embellished, which may not perfectly match the simplicity suggested in the prompt.

The left one is better because it aligns more closely with the text's straightforward description of a "brown dresser."

Final answer:
