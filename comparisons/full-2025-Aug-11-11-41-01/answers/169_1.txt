Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear pink and grey pattern with alternating sections.
   - The right one features a floral pattern that may not accurately reflect the text prompt of a "pink and grey cushion."
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid and maintains a consistent cushion shape.
   - The right object looks overly complex, with fabric-like extensions that differ from standard cushion designs.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object’s texture follows the basic cushion geometry.
   - The right object’s complex texture does not align well with typical cushion shapes.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object’s texture is clear and consistent with cushion aesthetics.
   - The right object’s floral pattern appears detailed but does not align with the text description.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has distinct geometric detailing consistent with a cushion.
   - The right object shows irregular geometry that detracts from a cushion-like appearance.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left object reflects the text description and maintains realistic geometry and texture.
   - The left one is better.
