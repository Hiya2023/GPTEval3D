Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The sofa is depicted with a multi-colored pattern and has visible armrests and cushions. However, it doesnâ€™t match the "yellow" color specified in the prompt.
   - Right (object 2): This model accurately captures the "yellow" color described in the prompt and shows a plush texture consistent with a sofa.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
