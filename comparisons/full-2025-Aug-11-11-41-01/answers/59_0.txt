Analysis:
1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a red car, but the house is unclear. The right model has a clear red car but the beige house background is better represented.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has more irregular structures and noise, while the right model appears more solid and natural.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture is misaligned with its geometry, whereas the right model shows better alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left has noticeable noise and lack of detail, while the right captures finer details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has disorganized and noisy geometry, whereas the right model has more coherent and detailed geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right model is more complete and accurately represents the prompt.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
