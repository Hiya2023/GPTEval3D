Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a rough, abstract yellow form that could be interpreted as a cat but lacks clear definition.
   - The right one clearly represents a sofa with cushion details, though the color does not match the "white" prompt. A cat is not apparent.
   - The right one is better, as it aligns more with the "sofa" part of the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks coherence and appears irregular with possibly strange shapes, making it less plausible as a cat on a sofa.
   - The right one is a recognizable sofa structure with detailed elements, making it more plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one is uniform with minimal texture detail.
   - The right one has discernible patterns and colors on the sofa, indicating sharper and more detailed textures.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
