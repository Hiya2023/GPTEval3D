Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a primarily white surface with golden patterns that resemble the prompt "a white vase with golden patterns." 
   - The right object features a more colorful design, possibly deviating from the white and gold description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears more solid and adheres to typical vase shapes, though details may seem exaggerated.
   - The right object also has a cohesive vase shape but may be visually distorted due to excessive colors.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object shows more textured details, though it may look noisy.
   - The right object's patterns are smoother, with less noise, and have noticeable details.
   - The right one is better.
