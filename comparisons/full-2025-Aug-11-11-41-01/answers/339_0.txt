Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a vase that features white surfaces with dispersed golden patterns, but the patterns seem less defined and irregular.
   - The right one also presents a white vase with golden patterns that are more pronounced and evenly distributed.
   - The right one is better at covering the attributes in the text prompt "A white vase with golden patterns."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have some irregularities and potential duplication in the patterns, which might affect the solidity.
   - The right one looks more consistent and solid, with a clearer and more realistic pattern layout.
   - The right one is more plausible and normal.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has textures that appear less sharp and somewhat noisy.
   - The right one exhibits sharper, more detailed, and realistic textures in the local areas.
   - The right one is better in terms of texture sharpness and detail.
