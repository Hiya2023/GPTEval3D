Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) visually aligns with the description "a yellow sofa" due to its distinct bright yellow color and sofa-like structure.
   - The right one (object 2) also aligns well with the description as it maintains a yellow hue and a recognizable sofa shape.
   - The left one is better because of its clearer, brighter yellow color which matches the prompt more explicitly.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have a solid form but with some unusual patterns that might distract from typical plausibility.
   - The right one seems more coherent and realistic as a sofa without strange body problems or duplicated parts.
   - The right one is better due to its more normal and solid appearance.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a detailed, intricate pattern giving it a sharp and vivid texture.
   - The right one has more subtle texture details which might appear smoother but less vivid.
   - The left one is better for its sharper and more detailed texture.
