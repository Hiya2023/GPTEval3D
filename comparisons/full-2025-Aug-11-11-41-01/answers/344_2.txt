Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts a potted green plant with large leaves, aligning well with "a green plant" but lacks a visible "white window."
   - The right one shows smaller, individual green leaves that do not include a pot or window, which doesn't cover all attributes.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows a coherent and solid structure with a clear pot and plant form, appearing more plausible as a 3D object.
   - The right one consists of floating leaves without a clear cohesive structure or a pot, appearing less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more detailed and realistic textures on the pot and leaves, with variation and texture depth.
   - The right one displays less detailed and simpler textures, lacking depth.
   - The left one is better.
