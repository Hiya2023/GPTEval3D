Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The object appears to be a sofa but lacks a clear yellow coloration; it seems more muted or possibly greenish. The shape and overall form are recognizable as a sofa.
   - Right (object 2): The object clearly reflects a yellow sofa, matching the prompt description in both color and shape.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
