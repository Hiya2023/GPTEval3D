Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- **Left (object 1)**: The object has a clear cushion shape and exhibits both pink and grey colors, though the pink is more dominant with a patterned appearance. The normal map shows detailed curvature consistent with a cushion.

- **Right (object 2)**: This object also resembles a cushion but is less distinct in shape and texture. It mainly appears in grey with slight pink tints, and the surface details are less pronounced in the normal maps.

The left one better captures both the shape and the color attributes described in the text prompt.
