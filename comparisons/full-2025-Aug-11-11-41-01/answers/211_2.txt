Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model closely resembles a traditional dresser with a clear, clean design and brown color. It has multiple drawers and a uniform texture, which aligns well with the text prompt of "A brown dresser."
   - The right model has an ornate and more decorative design with complex curves and patterns. While it is also brown, the added embellishments and detailing deviate slightly from a simple dresser description.

The left one is better.
