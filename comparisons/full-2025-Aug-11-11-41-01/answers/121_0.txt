Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a variety of colors, not predominantly yellow, while the right one is consistently yellow. The right one better matches the prompt "A yellow sofa."
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more structured and solid as a sofa; the right one lacks clear form and definition.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s geometry and textures align well; the right one has mismatched, noisy texturing.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays clear patterns and details without blurring; the right is mostly texture-less and blurry.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has defined, smooth surfaces; the right is undefined with irregularities.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left one offers better structure and detail, although the right aligns with the color prompt.
   The left one is better.
