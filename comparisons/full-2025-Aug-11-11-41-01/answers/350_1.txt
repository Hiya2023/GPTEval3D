Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object is a sofa with a vivid yellow floral pattern, which matches the "yellow sofa" prompt well, with a more vibrant color.
   - The right object is also a sofa in yellow but with a more uniform color, lacking the vividness that might be expected from a straightforward "yellow sofa".

   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid but has a complex design that might not be as structurally typical for a sofa.
   - The right object appears more solid and typical in its form as a sofa, with clear armrests and cushions.

   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a rich, detailed texture with intricate patterns that stand out.
   - The right object's texture is smoother and lacks detailed features.

   The left one is better.
