Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object poorly represents the car and the house; the right object has a clearer representation of both a red car and a beige house.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object lacks detail and structure; the right object has better-defined shapes and structures.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture and geometry are mismatched; the right object shows better coherence between texture and geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object is blurry; the right object captures more fine details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has less defined geometry; the right object is more detailed.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object is superior in almost all evaluated criteria.
   The right one is better.
