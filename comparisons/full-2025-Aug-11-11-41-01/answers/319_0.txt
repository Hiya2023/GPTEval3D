Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a turquoise color but lacks clear brass handles or detailed features typically seen in a desk. 
   - The right one is also turquoise and appears to have brass-like accents on the edges, more closely resembling handles.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has legs that appear too narrow, and there's a lack of solid, plausible 3D structure.
   - The right one appears more stable and desk-like, with a more defined shape and coherent structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one appears blurry and lacks detailed texture in the RGB images.
   - The right one shows sharper edges and more detailed textures, especially with brass-like accents.
   - The right one is better.
