Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a black lamp, consistent with the prompt.
   - The right object is not black, and does not fully align with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears mostly coherent but has minor issues.
   - The right object looks more solid and plausible in its structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object's textures are less clear and detailed.
   - The right object has sharper and more detailed textures.
   - The right one is better.
