Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: The left one shows intricate designs and an ornate style but includes additional colors. The right one is simpler and more true to "A brown dresser."
   The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: The left one has more complex shapes that seem less realistic. The right one appears more solid and plausible with simpler lines.
   The right one is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: The left one shows misalignment with textures appearing chaotic. The right one has a smoother alignment between geometry and texture.
   The right one is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: The left one is more detailed but cluttered and lacks focus. The right one has smoother textures that align better with the object's simplicity.
   The right one is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: The left one exhibits more detail but includes random, noisy elements. The right one has a cleaner, more efficient geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. **Overall**, the right one consistently better represents the criteria evaluated.
   The right one is better.
