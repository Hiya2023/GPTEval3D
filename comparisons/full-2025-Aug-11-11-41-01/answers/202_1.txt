Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (1) is a red ball on a blue background, lacking a chair, thus not fully aligning with the prompt.
   - The right object (2) shows a red ball and a chair, but the color and position might not be exact as the chair should be blue and the ball should be under it.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
