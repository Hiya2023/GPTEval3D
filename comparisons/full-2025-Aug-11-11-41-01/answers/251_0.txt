Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1):** The object resembles a cat with some abstraction but lacks clear definition and texture to convincingly represent a cat. The background doesn't resemble a sofa.
   - **Right (object 2):** The object more clearly resembles a cat with defined features and appropriate coloration. The background appears more like a sofa, aligning better with the white color mentioned.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
