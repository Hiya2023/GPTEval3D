Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: Appears to be a proper lamp, with a base and a shade, but it isn't black.
   - The right one: Does not resemble a lamp; appears more like a cone or a cylindrical object.

The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Looks more like a complete and plausible lamp.
   - The right one: Has unusual shapes and does not resemble a lamp, making it less plausible.

The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Textures appear smoother but lack sharp details.
   - The right one: More detailed, but noisy and lacks clarity.

The left one is better.
