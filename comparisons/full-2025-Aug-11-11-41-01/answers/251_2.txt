Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) lacks clear depiction of the cat and sofa. The surface texture and shape do not show distinct features of a yellow cat or a white sofa.
   - The right one (object 2) clearly shows a cat and the details of a sofa. The cat is visible with a texture that aligns well with being a yellowish cat, and the sofa is white, as described in the prompt.
   
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
