Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is more straightforward and resembles a conventional dresser shape, aligning well with the prompt "a brown dresser." The right one has a more elaborate design that may not be as closely aligned with a typical dresser description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more solid and realistic shape typical of a dresser. The right one, while more detailed, appears less plausible due to its extravagant form.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a more consistent alignment between its geometry and texture. The right one shows mismatches where the detailed textures do not fit the exaggerated geometric shapes.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right object has more intricate texture details. The left object appears more uniform and less detailed in texture.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The right object shows more intricate geometry, while the left is simpler and more straightforward, with less detail.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria, the left object aligns better with a typical, plausible "brown dresser."
The left one is better.
