Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model resembles a basic table design but appears rough and not entirely aligned with a "white table" description. The right model has a clearer table structure with distinct features like a tabletop and a base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks unusually shaped and lacks clear detail, appearing less plausible.
   - The right model has a defined structure with a distinguishable tabletop and stand, making it appear more solid and credible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a rough texture without clear features.
   - The right model shows more detailed textures and color variation, enhancing its realism and detail.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
