Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left object has a pattern with purple and possibly some other colors but seems to have white legs.
   - The right object is predominantly purple with distinct white legs.
   - The right one better matches the prompt of "A purple chair with white legs."
   - **The right one is better.**

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - The left object has complex shapes and elements that may not represent a standard chair design, potentially causing confusion regarding its solidity and plausibility.
   - The right object maintains a more typical chair profile, appearing solid and structurally sound.
   - **The right one is better.**

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 
   - The left object shows more complex textures but may appear noisy and less defined.
   - The right object has simpler textures, but they are clearer and more focused.
   - **The right one is better.**
