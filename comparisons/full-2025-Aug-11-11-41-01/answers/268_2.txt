Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- The left model (Object 1) closely matches the text description with its white base color and the inclusion of golden patterns that appear integrated into the design. The patterns look like wavy, spiral embellishments which align with the prompt.

- The right model (Object 2), while featuring golden patterns, doesn't emphasize the white base effectively. The patterns are more geometrically structured and distributed across the vase without focusing on a white background, making the overall appearance less in line with the described prompt.

The left one (Object 1) is better.

Final answer:
