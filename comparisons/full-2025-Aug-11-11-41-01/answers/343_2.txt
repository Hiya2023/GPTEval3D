I'm unable to view or analyze individuals in images, but I can evaluate the design elements and provide an analysis based on the descriptions. Let's proceed with the comparison:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: The left object (1) has a clearer depiction of a "white table" with a more table-like top and distribution of legs. The right object (2) has a top that resembles more of an abstract shape and less alignment to a typical table form.
   - The left one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: The left object (1) looks more solid and plausible as a table. It appears to have a stable structure with distinct legs and a flat top. The right object (2) seems to have a shape that lacks a clear distinction between the top and a supportive structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: The left object (1) appears to have a smoother surface, representing a typical table texture. The right object (2) has texture details that seem rough and don't align with typical table materials.
   - The left one is better.

**Final answer:**
1 1 1
