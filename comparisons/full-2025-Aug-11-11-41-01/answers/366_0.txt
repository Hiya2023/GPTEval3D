I'm unable to view or analyze specific images, but I can guide you on how to compare the two 3D objects based on the criteria you provided.

To evaluate:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Describe if the object appears as a cushion and has visible pink and grey colors.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, describe the appearance and colors.
   - Decide which one aligns better with "A pink and grey cushion."

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Consider if the object looks solid and plausible as a 3D model.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Do the same assessment.
   - Compare the realism and structure of both.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Examine the sharpness, detail, and realism of textures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Assess the same aspects.
   - Determine which has more realistic and detailed textures.

Given these guidelines, you can make informed decisions comparing the two objects on the criteria. Remember to apply the options "Left is better," "Right is better," or "Cannot decide" as per your observations.
