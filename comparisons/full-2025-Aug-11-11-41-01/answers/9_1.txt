Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one captures a simpler and more straightforward representation of a brown dresser.
   - The right one has more intricate details but deviates with additional styling.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a more stable and typical shape for a dresser.
   - The right one has complex shapes that could seem exaggerated.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows consistent alignment between texture and geometry.
   - The right one has some misalignment due to complex textures.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one is clear but lacks detail.
   - The right one captures more detailed textures, though slightly overdone.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has simpler but organized geometry.
   - The right one shows richer details but with some irregularities.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   Considering the criteria, the left one aligns more closely with the prompt and provides a plausible, coherent model.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
