Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a darker appearance, while the right one is white, aligning better with the prompt "A white table."
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears solid but its color is off. The right one, despite being white, has more natural proportions and details.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture does not align well with its geometry. The right one shows better consistency, resembling a table more accurately in both views.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears blurry, while the right one captures finer details in its texture.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks detailed geometry, while the right one displays more intricate and visually pleasing shapes.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one more closely meets the criteria across all aspects.
The right one is better.
