Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a blue chair with a more distinctive pattern and visible armrests, which fits the "blue chair" part well, but the desk is not visible.
   - The right one is a simpler blue chair, fitting the basic "blue chair" description, and there's a slight indication of a desk-like shadow or object.
   - Cannot decide which is better as both don't fully represent the complete prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears complex with more defined features and structure, but also somewhat visually cluttered.
   - The right one presents a clean, solid shape with simpler features, making it more plausible as a 3D object.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more intricate textures and details on the chair surface, making it visually richer.
   - The right one has plainer textures with fewer details.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 1
