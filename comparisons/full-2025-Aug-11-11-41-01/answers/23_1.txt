Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left sofa is clearly yellow as described in the prompt, while the right sofa does not accurately reflect the color. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left sofa has more natural and solid shapes, with appropriate proportions. The right sofa has some irregularities in shape. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left sofa's texture aligns well with its shape, as seen in both RGB and normal maps. The right one shows misalignment between texture and shape. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left sofa captures fine details with a clear texture, while the right one appears more abstract and less detailed. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left sofa shows a well-organized structure and intricate details, while the right one has less defined geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left sofa aligns better with the prompt and exhibits superior detail and coherence. The left one is better.
