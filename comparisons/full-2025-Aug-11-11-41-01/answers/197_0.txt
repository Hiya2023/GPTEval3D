Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model shows a series of plant stalks with leaves, matching the "green plant" part of the prompt but lacks a clear representation of the "white window."
   - The right model displays both a green plant and a rectangular frame that suggests a window, fulfilling the entire prompt more effectively.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more natural in its presentation of plant structures, but it lacks overall scene context.
   - The right model, despite some structural noise, presents a recognizable plant within a window frame.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model shows consistent geometry and texture alignment across its plant structures.
   - The right model also demonstrates good alignment between geometry and texture, especially in the window area.
   - Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's texture is slightly blurred and lacks fine detail.
   - The right model captures more detail in areas like the leaves and frame.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model presents a smoother and more organized geometry in its plant structure.
   - The right model has some noise but maintains better detail overall.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the right model better represents the prompt with more detail and plausibility.
   - The right one is better.
