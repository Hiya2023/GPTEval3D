Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a darker vase and table which aligns with the description, but the right one maintains the black vase better. The left one is better overall.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has more natural proportions for the vase and table, while the right one shows some distortion. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows a good match between texture and geometry in both RGB and normal images. The right one exhibits some misalignment. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures details better in the texture without blurring, especially on the table. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother and more detailed geometry in the normal maps, without unnecessary noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one is well-rounded and captures the description accurately.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
