Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more ornate design with visible, colorful textures, while the right one is more subdued and appears more like a traditional brown dresser. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has an inconsistent shape with distractions. The right one appears more natural and solid, fitting the general silhouette of a dresser. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left oneâ€™s texture appears mismatched with its geometry, while the right one shows better alignment between its wood texture and dresser shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is too stylized, with colors that don't fit the prompt. The right one offers more coherent and realistic textures that align with a brown dresser. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows unnecessary noise and lacks coherence. The right one displays smoother and more logical geometry that fits the expected form of a dresser. The right one is better.

6. Overall, based on the criteria evaluated, the right one meets the expectations of a "brown dresser" more effectively. The right one is better.
