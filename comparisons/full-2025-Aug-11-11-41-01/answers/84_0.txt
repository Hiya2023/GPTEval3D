Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is uniformly blue and represents a simple chair design. The right object includes multiple colors beyond blue, deviating from the prompt. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a consistent shape and appears more like a typical chair, while the right one has unusual proportions and additional colors.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture aligns well with its geometry, matching both RGB and normal maps. The right one's textures are inconsistent and mismatched.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object shows clear texture without blurring. The right object's texture is less defined and appears noisy.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits smoother and more defined geometry. The right object has irregularities and less clarity.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object satisfies the requirements for a "blue chair" more effectively across all criteria.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
