Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more cohesive and consistent with a black lamp design; the right one introduces more color inappropriately. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more solid and consistent; the right one has more irregularities and inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s texture aligns better with its geometry; the right one suffers from misalignment due to random colors.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details without appearing chaotic; the right one appears noisy.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a more organized structure; the right one is less coherent in its geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model consistently performs better across all criteria.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
