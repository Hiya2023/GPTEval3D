1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (Object 1): The model captures a red car, but lacks clear representation of the "beige house." The car's shape is a bit abstract.
   - Right (Object 2): The model clearly depicts a red car with more realistic details and incorporates the presence of a house more clearly, showing improved alignment with the prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
