Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object clearly represents a "brown dresser" with drawers and a traditional shape, whereas the right object is less recognizable with a less defined form.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more natural and solid, with realistic proportions and structure typical of a dresser. The right object has unusual proportions.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture and geometry of the left object align well, with consistent detailing across surfaces. The right object shows misalignment between texture and geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object displays finer textural details, with clear definition and realistic representation of wood patterns. The right object appears blurry.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's normal map shows well-defined details corresponding to the dresser's shape, while the right object lacks clarity and exhibits noise.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the combination of clearer form, better alignment, and detailed textures make the left object superior.
   The left one is better.
