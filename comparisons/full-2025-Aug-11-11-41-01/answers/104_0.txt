Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures a purple chair with white legs accurately; The right one has a purple chair but less emphasis on white legs.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one appears natural and solid with correct proportions; The right one has some irregular shapes.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one aligns well between RGB and normal images; The right one shows some mismatch.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one has clear textures; The right one appears somewhat blurry.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one has well-defined geometry; The right one has noise and less organization.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model captures the intended design more effectively across all criteria.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
