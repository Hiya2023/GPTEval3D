Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is a pink vase with abstract patterns that cover the entire surface. It aligns with the color aspect of the prompt but lacks explicit representation of a "brown shelf."
   - The right model is also a pink vase, with more decorative and detailed bands, likely aligning with the "vase" part. However, like the left model, it does not depict a "brown shelf."
   - Decision: Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid but has some abstract patterns that might be interpreted as noise. Its shape is consistent for a vase.
   - The right model is structured more traditionally for a vase, with clear detailing, making it seem more plausible as a coherent 3D object.
   - Decision: Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has vibrant colors and some textural detail, but the texture is somewhat diffuse and lacks sharpness.
   - The right model features sharper and more defined textures, especially in the decorative bands, offering a more realistic and detailed appearance.
   - Decision: Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
3 2 2
