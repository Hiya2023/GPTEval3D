Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a straightforward brown dresser with a clean design; the right one has more ornate detailing. The left one better captures a simple "brown dresser."
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more stable and proportionate, while the right one exhibits some strange curves that may seem less plausible as a physical object.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture is more aligned with its shape, maintaining the dresser's structure. The right one has a misalignment with its ornate curves.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has simple but clear textures. The right one is more detailed but appears noisy and less clear.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smooth and clear geometry, while the right one has excessive details that are not well-organized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns better with the prompt, is more plausible, and has a better texture to geometry alignment.
The left one is better.
