Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has intricate, inconsistent patterns that don't align well with the "brown sofa with black stripes" description. 
   - The right object better captures the overall color and style, resembling a brown sofa without apparent stripes.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears to have some distortions and irregular patterns.
   - The right object looks more like a cohesive and solid 3D model of a sofa.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object has misaligned textures that do not follow the shape effectively.
   - The right object's texture better aligns with the geometry of a sofa.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left object has more complex texture detail but appears chaotic.
   - The right object maintains a consistent texture, which is more fitting.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left object shows a variety of patterns but lacks coherent structure.
   - The right object has smoother and more organized geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   The right object is more aligned with the text prompt and demonstrates superior 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, and detail coherence.
   The right one is better.
