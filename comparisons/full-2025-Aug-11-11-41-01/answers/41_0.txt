Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more traditional dresser appearance, matching the prompt better; the right one's shape is more abstract.  
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more natural with consistent proportions. The right one has irregular and leaning shapes which seem less plausible.  
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left are better integrated with the geometry, while the right one has mismatches between the texture and shape alignment.  
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures finer details with clarity compared to the slightly blurred textures of the right one.  
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left presents a more organized and smooth structure with precise detail, whereas the right appears noisy and unfinished.  
   The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model outperforms in reflecting the text prompt, being more plausible, aligning textures with geometry, and capturing fine details.  
   The left one is better.
