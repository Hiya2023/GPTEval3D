Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is floral with white legs, not totally purple; The right one has purple upholstery and white legs.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one is less defined with smoother lines; The right one has clean and plausible structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s texture is less coherent; The right one’s texture aligns well with its form.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is floral, but not detailed; The right one shows details more clearly and accurately.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks clear geometry details; The right one shows detailed geometry in normal maps.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one captures the prompt better, has more plausible structure, and aligns texture and geometry well.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
