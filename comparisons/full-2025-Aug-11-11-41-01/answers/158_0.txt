Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features a blue and gold pattern, which diverges from the "white vase" prompt. The right one is predominantly white with golden patterns, matching the description. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a uniform geometric shape but incorrect color. The right one maintains a plausible vase shape and color scheme.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows misalignment between patterns and the 3D shape. The right object exhibits better alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture appears vibrant but not detailed. The right model captures fine details realistically.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has clear geometric form but lacks fine detail. The right model's geometry matches well with its texture and has intricate details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model aligns more closely with the text description and technical criteria.
The right one is better.
