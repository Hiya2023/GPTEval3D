Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- The left object (Object 1) appears to have a grid-like pattern but lacks a clear indication of depth or texture, which is not aligned with the "rug" aspect described in the text.

- The right object (Object 2) has a more textured surface and a better representation of a "rug" with its irregular surface and evident depth. The color aligns well with the "purple" description.

The right object (Object 2) is better.

Final answer:
2
