Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features a red car with vegetation-like structures, rather than a beige house. The right model shows a red car and similarly lacks the house. Both do not fully align with "A red car beside a beige house."
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has irregular structures, making it less plausible. The right model displays more consistent car-like shapes.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: In the left model, textures do not align well with the shape, with vegetation not matching the car structure. The right model has consistent geometry and texture alignment.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are noisy and unclear. The right model has clearer details with better-defined car features.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows unorganized, noisy geometry. The right model presents smoother and more organized structure.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right model consistently performs better in terms of plausibility, alignment, and details.
   The right one is better.
