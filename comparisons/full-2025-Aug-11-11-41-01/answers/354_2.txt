Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is a brown sofa but lacks clear black stripes.
   - The right model contains both brown color and prominent black stripes.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid and more contiguous as a sofa.
   - The right model looks slightly distorted and contains noisy elements in the structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a uniform but less detailed texture.
   - The right model's texture is more detailed and varied.
   - The right one is better.
