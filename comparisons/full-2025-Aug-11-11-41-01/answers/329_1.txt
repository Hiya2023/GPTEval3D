Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: Has colorful, floral, and abstract patterns with some golden accents, but the dominant color isn't white.
   - The right one: Displays more of a white base with distinct golden and blue patterns, aligning more closely with the "white vase with golden patterns."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Appears quite solid and vase-like but the mix of colors and patterns reduces realism.
   - The right one: More traditional and plausible as a vase with a consistent design and pattern.

   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Textures are vibrant but may appear too busy and slightly blurred.
   - The right one: Textures are sharper and more distinct.

   - The right one is better.
