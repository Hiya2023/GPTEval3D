Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more abstract and lacks a solid, recognizable cushion structure.
   - The right one resembles a cushion and matches the color scheme of pink and grey more clearly.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one presents a fragmented and unclear structure with no clear notion of solidity or form.
   - The right one has a cohesive and plausible cushion shape with normal and RGB images supporting the 3D structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one lacks texture details due to its abstract nature.
   - The right one displays clearer, more realistic, and detailed textures fitting for a cushion.
   - The right one is better.
