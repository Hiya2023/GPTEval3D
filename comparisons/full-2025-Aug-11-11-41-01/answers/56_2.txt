Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is clearly a yellow sofa; the right one appears more abstract and less defined in terms of color and shape.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks solid and plausible as a 3D sofa; the right one has more noise and less clear structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows well-aligned textures with the shape; the right one has noisy geometry-texture alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures fine texture details more effectively; the right one is blurry with less defined textures.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows organized geometry; the right one has noisy normal maps.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one reflects a better model across all criteria.
The left one is better.
