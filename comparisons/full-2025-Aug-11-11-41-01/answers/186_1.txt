2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks solidity and natural appearance; The right one, while imperfect, appears more structured.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has misaligned textures and geometry; The right one shows better alignment between textures and shapes.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has unclear textures; The right one shows more detail and definition.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks detailed geometry; The right one captures more intricate and organized details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: Right one aligns better with the prompt and has superior details and structure.
The right one is better.
