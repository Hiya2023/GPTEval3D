Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears to focus on the color aspect, with pink and grey tones, but lacks clear structure; the right one exhibits floral patterns overlaid on the cushion while still showing pink hues.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has irregular and inconsistent shapes, while the right one has a more defined structure that resembles a cushion.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one lacks distinct geometric alignment to its texture; the right one has a clear pattern that matches the cushion shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is quite blurry and lacks detail; the right one shows more detailed floral patterns.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has less defined geometry; the right one shows more detailed normal mapping corresponding to the shape.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, based on alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometric detail, the right one is more coherent and plausible.
The right one is better.
