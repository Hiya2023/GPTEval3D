Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one aligns more closely with the text prompt "A black lamp" as it primarily appears black.
   - The right one is green, which does not match the description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears somewhat abstract with the lower part not clearly defined and less solid.
   - The right one has a more structured appearance that looks more plausible as a lamp.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more cohesive texture, although it's less detailed.
   - The right one shows more detailed textures and clarity.
   - The right one is better.
