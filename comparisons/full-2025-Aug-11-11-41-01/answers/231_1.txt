Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left (object 1) depicts a red car with clear and consistent renderings across multiple views; however, it does not show a beige house.
   - The right (object 2) also shows a red car but similarly lacks any depiction of a beige house.
   
Both models only partially address the text prompt by rendering the car without including the house.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
