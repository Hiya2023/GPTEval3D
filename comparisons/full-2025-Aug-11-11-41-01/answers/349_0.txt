I'm unable to directly provide a detailed comparison, but I can offer a summation on the fundamental aspects of the criteria:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears as a green car, which doesn't match the "red car" prompt.
   - The right one shows red colors but lacks the structure of a car.
   - The right one is somewhat better as it matches the red color.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a solid car shape.
   - The right one lacks any distinct car shape, appearing as abstract shapes.
   - The left one is better in plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has discernible features like headlights and wheels.
   - The right one lacks textural details important for identifying a car.
   - The left one is better for texture.

Final answer:
2 1 1
