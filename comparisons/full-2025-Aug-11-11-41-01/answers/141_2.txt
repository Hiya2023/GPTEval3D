Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a black vase, but the table is not visible; the right model shows a brown table but no vase.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has irregularities with vase texture; the right model's table seems plausible.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's vase texture does not align well with geometry; the right model's table aligns better.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's vase lacks detail; the right model's table has better texture detail.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has noise on the vase; the right model shows a clearer table structure.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the details above, the right model is better.
The right one is better.
