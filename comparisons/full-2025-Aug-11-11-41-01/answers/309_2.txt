Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left object appears to depict a multi-colored chair with a red ball underneath, aligning well with the prompt "A red ball under a blue chair," although the chair isn't strictly blue.
   - The right object shows a blue ball but lacks any chair structure.
   
   The left one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - The left object is more complex and has a clear chair structure with a distinct shape, alongside the ball.
   - The right object is a simple sphere and seems less complex in its 3D structure.
   
   The left one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 
   - The left object has detailed textures on the chair, showing a pattern and more complexity.
   - The right object appears smoother with less textured detail.
   
   The left one is better.
