Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a predominantly floral pattern without clear purple; the right one has a clearer purple tone and white legs. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural with realistic chair proportions; the right one has awkward and exaggerated features. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left aligns better with the geometry. The right one has mismatched textures and distorted geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has finer texture details, whereas the right one is stylized and abstract. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one maintains smoother and more coherent geometry; the right one looks distorted. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one is more coherent and plausible besides the color mismatch. The left one is better.

Final answer:
2 1 1 1 1 1
