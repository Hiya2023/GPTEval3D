Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: The object appears fragmented with a lack of solid form. It doesn't resemble a cushion and doesn't align well with the prompt description of "a pink and grey cushion."
   - The right one: The object displays a coherent cushion shape with visible pink and grey colors, closely aligning with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: The object seems to lack a solid structure, appearing more like scattered shapes rather than a cohesive 3D model.
   - The right one: The object resembles a realistic cushion with a plausible 3D form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: The texture is vague and lacks detail, with unclear definition.
   - The right one: The texture is sharper and more detailed, reflecting a more realistic representation.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
