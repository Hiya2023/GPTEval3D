Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple, plain white table with a straightforward design.
   - The right one has a more complex stand structure and colored tabletop, diverging from the "white table" prompt.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears normal and solid without any notable structural issues.
   - The right one displays odd formations and inconsistencies, particularly in the textures and table base.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one features a very plain texture with minimal details.
   - The right one, although with color, seems to have more detailed texture, providing a sense of material.
   The right one is better.
