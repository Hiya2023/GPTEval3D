Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) appears to be a blue chair, closely aligning with the text prompt. However, there is no indication of a black desk present in the renderings.
   - The right one (object 2) is also a blue chair, but with no visible black desk.
   - Cannot decide (neither object includes all attributes of the prompt).

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one (object 1) looks like a well-defined chair model and seems more solid with clear structure.
   - The right one (object 2) has textural noise and indistinct structures, making it look less plausible.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one (object 1) has minimal texture, appearing almost flat in certain areas.
   - The right one (object 2) has more visible texture details, though they are somewhat noisy.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
