Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object is yellow and fits the simple description of "a yellow sofa."
   - The right object incorporates additional textures and colors, which diverges from the prompt's simplicity.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks more natural and consistent as a sofa.
   - The right object has odd textures that make it appear less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object has consistent texture and geometry alignment.
   - The right object has mismatching textures and shapes.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object maintains clarity in its texture.
   - The right object appears noisy with less coherent detail.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object's geometry appears more structured and smooth.
   - The right object is less coherent with unnecessary details.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left object fulfills the prompt better with a natural and cohesive representation.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
