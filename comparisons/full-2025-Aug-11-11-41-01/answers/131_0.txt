Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a patterned texture that doesn’t clearly communicate "a yellow sofa," whereas the right one more accurately represents a yellow sofa. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has irregularities due to the busy pattern, whereas the right one looks more uniform and solid. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s texture and geometry are misaligned with the patterned texture, while the right maintains a consistent color and form that aligns better. 
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left texture has unnecessary complexity with a pattern that obscures detail; the right is simpler with a texture reflecting the prompt better. 
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows less defined geometry due to the busyness of the texture, while the right has a smoother and more coherent geometry. 
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model is consistently more aligned with the text prompt and has better plausibility and detail. 
The right one is better.
