Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more green than yellow, which doesn't completely match the prompt. The texture looks like fabric and it has a clear sofa shape.
   - The right one is a vivid yellow, aligning better with the prompt. The shape is more abstract and less defined as a typical sofa.

The right one is better for color accuracy, but the left one has a more recognizable sofa shape.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
