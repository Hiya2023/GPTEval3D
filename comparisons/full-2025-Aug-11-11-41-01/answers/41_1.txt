Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one resembles a brown dresser more closely with distinct drawers and hardware; the right one appears less defined.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and balanced, whereas the right one has irregular shapes.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its shape; the right one shows misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clearer details and textures; the right one looks blurry.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more organized geometry; the right one has more noise and irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model accurately represents a brown dresser with better structure and texture.
The left one is better.
