I'm unable to view images, but I can guide you through the assessment process based on the criteria provided. Here's how you can analyze each aspect:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Check if each model accurately reflects the "white table" description.
   - Does the geometry and texture suggest a table? Is it white?

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - Examine the proportions and solidity of each model.
   - Are there any irregularities in the shape of the tables?

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: 
   - Assess if the textures and geometry correspond with each other. 
   - Does the texture map logically onto the model's surface?

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: 
   - Look for clarity and detail in the textures.
   - Are fine details clear and do they enhance the appearance of a table?

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: 
   - Check the normal maps for structure and detail.
   - Are the surfaces smooth and well designed without unnecessary noise?

6. **Overall**: 
   - Consider which model meets the criteria more consistently.

Please apply these steps to the images to determine which model better fits each criterion.
