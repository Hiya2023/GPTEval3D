Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model represents a four-legged table, whereas the right model is a pedestal table. The left model better matches the generic description of "a white table."
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more stable and natural as a table with standard proportions. The right model has some unusual proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns better with its structure, as it maintains a uniform appearance across the surface. The right model shows some misalignment between texture and form.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model maintains consistent texture details, while the right model appears more abstract and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more consistent and well-organized geometric details compared to the right one, which has irregular shapes.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left one is better.
The left one is better.
