Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: Left (object 1) is a simplistic form with a dark color that fits the description of "a black lamp." It maintains a more consistent, lamp-like shape across views. Right (object 2), features a more complex form with colors and textures not matching the specified "black" in the prompt. The structure does not clearly resemble a lamp. 

The left one is better.

Final answer:
