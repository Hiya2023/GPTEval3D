Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a table structure with legs and a surface, but it is not white, contradicting the text prompt.
   - The right one also resembles a table, but it is difficult to perceive the color due to grayscale rendering.

The right one, albeit unclear in color, aligns more with a simplistic table shape. The left one is disqualified for not fitting the color attribute. Thus, the text alignment cannot be clearly decided.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a normal table structure with no strange body problems or duplicated parts.
   - The right one appears to have unstable or distorted structures, particularly in the support area, making it less plausible as a functional table.

The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.
   
3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows detailed textures with distinct colors, though not matching the prompt.
   - The right one lacks detailed textures due to its grayscale presentation.

The left one is better due to sharper and more detailed textures.

Final answer:
