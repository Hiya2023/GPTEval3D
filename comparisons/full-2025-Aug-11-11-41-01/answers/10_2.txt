Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model captures a brown dresser with clear drawer outlines and appropriate structure. The right model also represents a dresser but appears less structurally defined. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and solid compared to the right, which seems distorted. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has textures that align well with the geometry. The right model's textures don't adhere closely to its shape. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer texture details and appears sharper compared to the right model, which looks blurred. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more intricate and organized geometry as seen in the normal map, whereas the right model seems less detailed. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model excels in all the criteria, making it the better choice overall. The left one is better.
