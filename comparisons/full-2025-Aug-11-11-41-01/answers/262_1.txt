Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The left images show a green bicycle with a grey dog beside it. The bicycle and dog are well-defined and the color attributes are accurately captured.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The right images display a grey dog beside a green bicycle as well, but the alignment seems a bit off. The colors are correct, but the positioning and size of the objects may not be as clearly defined as in the left images.

The left one provides a clearer depiction and better captures the elements and attributes described in the prompt.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
