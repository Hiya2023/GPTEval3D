Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one does not clearly resemble a lamp. The structure appears more like a complex mechanical part or a tool rather than a lighting fixture.
   - The right one clearly resembles a lamp and aligns well with the text prompt "A black lamp."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a complex shape with no clear function related to a lamp. The structure looks intricate, suggesting potential issues with plausibility as a lamp.
   - The right one has a simple and plausible structure consistent with a standard lamp, looking solid and appropriate for the function.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a detailed texture with multiple colors and intricate patterns, though it might seem too noisy for a lamp.
   - The right one has a simpler texture, fitting the idea of a black lamp with less noise.
   - The right one is better.
