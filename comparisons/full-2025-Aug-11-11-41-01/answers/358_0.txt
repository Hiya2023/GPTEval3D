Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a basic structure that might resemble a sofa but lacks discernible features such as clear black stripes or detailed sofa shape.
   - The right one clearly depicts a sofa with a detailed pattern that resembles the description more closely.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears abstract and lacks solid structure, making it difficult to visualize as a plausible 3D object.
   - The right one has a clear and solid 3D structure that is more normal and visually coherent.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has unclear textures and lacks detail.
   - The right one has sharper, more detailed textures, making it more realistic and appealing.
   - The right one is better.
