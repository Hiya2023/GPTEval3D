Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one includes recognizable desk features like drawers and brass handles, although the desk's color is more muted. The right one does not clearly resemble a desk and lacks visible brass handles.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more like a solid, structured piece of furniture with recognizable parts. The right model looks unstable and lacks coherent desk-like forms.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures align better with its geometry, showing clear desk-like structures. The right model has textures that don't match the implied desk structure.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model shows more precise details with defined textures, whereas the right one appears overly simplistic and abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits more organized geometry with clear desk components, while the right one is less defined and has less-efficient structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model better reflects the prompt and exhibits superior details and structure.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
