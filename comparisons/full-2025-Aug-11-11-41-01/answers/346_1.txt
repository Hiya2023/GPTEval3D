**Analysis:**

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**

   - **Left (Object 1):** The model is a brown sofa with black stripes mostly aligned vertically. The colors appear consistent with the text description.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The model is also a brown sofa with black stripes, though the pattern is more varied, featuring a mix of diagonal and vertical stripes. It also includes additional elements like cushions which may add to or distract from alignment with the prompt.

   **The left one is better** for more consistently aligning with the simple text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility:**

   - **Left (Object 1):** This model appears plausible with a consistent structure, and no apparent issues with form.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The model also appears plausible, but with slightly more complexity due to additional elements like legs and cushions, which might introduce some less structured elements.

   **The left one is better** as it presents a simpler, solid form.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**

   - **Left (Object 1):** The texture is clear, though not as detailed in terms of realism.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The texture appears sharper and more detailed, especially in the cushions and fabric representation.

   **The right one is better** for its more detailed and realistic texture.

**Final answer:**
