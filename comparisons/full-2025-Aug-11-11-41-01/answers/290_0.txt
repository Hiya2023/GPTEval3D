Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (Object 1): This image depicts a sofa with patterns and pillows but lacks the presence of a cat, which is a significant omission from the text prompt.
   - Right (Object 2): The image shows a yellow cat on a soft white surface, aligning well with the "yellow cat on a white sofa" description in the text prompt. However, the sofa details are less evident.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
