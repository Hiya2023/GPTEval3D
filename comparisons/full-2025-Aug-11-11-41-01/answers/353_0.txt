Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is a white vase with clear, large golden patterns in curved shapes. 
   - The right model is also a white vase but with smaller and more fragmented golden patterns.
   - The left one aligns better with the prompt "A white vase with golden patterns" due to clearer and more distinct patterns.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid and well-structured with no visible abnormalities.
   - The right model has fragmented parts that appear noisy and less cohesive.
   - The left one is more plausible as a 3D object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model exhibits smoother and more coherent textures, though slightly blurred.
   - The right model has more detailed textures but appears noisy and less defined in parts.
   - The right one has sharper and more detailed textures.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
