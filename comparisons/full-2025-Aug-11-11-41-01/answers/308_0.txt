Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object does not resemble a lamp. Its shape seems abstract without clear features of a lamp.
   - The right object resembles a pendant lamp and clearly fits the description of a "black lamp."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears to have an unclear structure with potential duplications and lacks a clear, solid form.
   - The right object appears more solid, typical of a pendant lamp's structure, with no apparent structural issues.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a textured pattern but lacks clarity and realism in the context of a lamp.
   - The right object, despite being simple, shows clearer and more realistic texture as a black lamp.
   - The right one is better.
