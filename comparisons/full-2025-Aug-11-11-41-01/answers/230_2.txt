Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The object primarily appears to be a spherical shape with visual characteristics that do not clearly define a chair or ball. The color blue is prominent, but the form does not align with the description of a "chair" or a "ball under it."
   - Right (object 2): This object clearly depicts a blue chair with a red ball situated below it. It aligns well with the text prompt, accurately representing both objects and their spatial relationship.

The right one (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
2
