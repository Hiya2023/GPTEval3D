Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left sofa is a plain brown, but lacks black stripes. The right sofa has a striped pattern incorporating black. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left sofa has a more natural shape and proportions. The right one appears less realistic due to color inconsistency.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left sofa's texture aligns well with its shape. The right sofa's texture is less consistent.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left sofa has clearer texture details. The right sofa's texture seems noisy and less defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left sofa shows smoother and more defined geometry in normal maps. The right one appears noisy and irregular.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left sofa provides a more natural and coherent 3D model, despite not fully matching the text prompt.
The left one is better.
