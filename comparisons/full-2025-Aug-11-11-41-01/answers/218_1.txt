Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one (object 1) is a desk but lacks clear details and does not have any visible brass handles. It does have a turquoise color, but the design is very abstract with no discernible handle details.
   - The right one (object 2) clearly shows a desk with a classic design, complete with visible brass handles on the drawers, matching the description well. The turquoise color is present and the overall design resembles a traditional desk structure.

The right one is better.
