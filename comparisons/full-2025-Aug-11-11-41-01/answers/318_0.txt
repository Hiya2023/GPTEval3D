Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a cushion shape with pink and grey colors, fitting the prompt description well.
   - The right object does not clearly resemble a cushion and is fragmented.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems more solid and has a coherent 3D shape representing a cushion.
   - The right object appears incoherent with broken and scattered parts.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more detailed and sharper textures, displaying flowers more clearly.
   - The right object lacks detailed textures and clarity.
   - The left one is better.
