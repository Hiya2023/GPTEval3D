Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a plain brown sofa without black stripes.
   - The right one has a brown texture with black stripes.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and natural.
   - The right one looks more like a 3D model.
   Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture is consistent but lacks detail.
   - The right one's stripes align well with the shape.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has consistent but simplistic details.
   - The right one captures more intricate textures.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has undefined geometry with noise.
   - The right one displays organized geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all factors, the right one aligns better with the prompt and exhibits superior detail.
   The right one is better.
