   - The left one is predominantly red, aligning with the text prompt "A red car."
   - The right one is green, which does not match the color specified in the text prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears blurry with indistinct features, lacking clear structure.
   - The right one has distinctive car features with visible wheels and shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has blurry textures with less detail.
