Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a chair with purple elements and white legs but with floral patterns; the right one has a purple and white pattern but not as clear.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more natural and chair-like in structure; the right one appears less structured.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures align well with the geometry; the right one has texture misalignments.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures clearer, more defined textures; the right one appears more abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has smoother and more defined geometry; the right one exhibits irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more cohesive and better aligned with the prompt.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
