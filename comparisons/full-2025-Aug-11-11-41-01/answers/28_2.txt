I'm unable to display or analyze images directly, but I can guide you on how to approach the comparison based on the provided criteria:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left:** Look at how well the elements align with "A green plant beside a white window." Check for the presence of both the plant and window, and their correct proportions.
   - **Right:** Do the same evaluation. Compare if both objects and their placement are according to the prompt.
   - Decide which one captures the description more accurately.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left:** Evaluate the naturalness, solidity, and plausibility of the structure. Look for any irregular shapes or structures.
   - **Right:** Similarly, assess this model for realistic appearance and structure.
   - Decide which one appears more plausible in three dimensions.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - **Left:** Check if the texture is well-aligned with the geometry. Ensure the normal map and RGB image match structurally.
   - **Right:** Perform the same evaluation for this model.
   - Choose the model with better alignment between texture and geometry.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - **Left:** Focus on the details in the RGB image. Evaluate sharpness and clarity.
   - **Right:** Assess the same aspects for this model.
   - Determine which model captures fine details without blurring.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - **Left:** Look at the normal maps for intricate geometry. Evaluate the smoothness and efficiency of structure.
   - **Right:** Do the same assessment here.
   - Decide which model has more defined and organized geometry.

6. **Overall**:
   - Review all criteria and decide which model performs better across the board.

Once you carry out these evaluations, you will arrive at a final decision based on each criterion. Just follow the analysis guidelines to help you make your comparison.
