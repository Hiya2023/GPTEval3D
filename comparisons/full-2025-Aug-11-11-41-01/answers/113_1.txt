Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures a simple yellow sofa but appears more textured; the right one is a more traditional sofa style with clearer yellow color and structure. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has an unclear shape and irregular structure; the right sofa appears more natural and structured.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows poor alignment between geometry and texture; the right one has better consistency in representing the sofa shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is overly textured without clear details; the right one shows finer details in texture.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a noisy and unordered structure; the right exhibits cleaner and more defined geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model is more consistent with the prompt, has better 3D plausibility, and more aligned geometry and texture.
The right one is better.
