Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a white vase with a few golden spiral patterns clearly visible; the right one has a more complex, mosaic-like golden pattern. The left one aligns more closely with "a white vase with golden patterns."
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural and solid, with a smooth and plausible vase shape. The right one seems irregular with texture noise affecting its structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its shape, maintaining consistency between the RGB and normal maps. The right model's texture appears misaligned and chaotic.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows clear, discernible texture without excessive blurring. The right one has noisy and overly complex patterns that detract from clarity.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays smooth and logical geometry with the normal maps enhancing detail naturally. The right one's geometry is too noisy and lacks cohesive detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model better fulfills all criteria, providing a clearer and more aligned representation of the prompt.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
