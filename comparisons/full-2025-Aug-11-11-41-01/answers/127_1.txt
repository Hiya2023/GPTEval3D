Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one accurately captures the shape and color of a brown dresser with drawers.
   - The right one also captures the dresser shape but may lack detail in structure.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a more realistic structure and proportion for a dresser.
   - The right one appears slightly less solid and defined.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model shows good alignment of texture to its geometry, with drawers reflected in both RGB and normal maps.
   - The right model shows some misalignment in its normals and texture.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model presents clearer, more detailed textures on the dresser surfaces.
   - The right one looks less defined and slightly blurry.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one captures detail in the dresserâ€™s form and structure without noise.
   - The right one has less detail and precision in its geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model consistently outperforms across all criteria and aligns well with the text prompt.
   - The left one is better.
