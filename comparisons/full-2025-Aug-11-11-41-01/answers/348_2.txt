Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts a red car with some background detail but lacks clear representation of the beige house.
   - The right one shows a red car, but the surrounding environment is not clearly defined enough to assess the presence of a beige house.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more detailed in terms of structure and context, resembling a plausible scene.
   - The right one has a basic form which might seem less detailed and defined.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more detailed texture in terms of colors and appears sharper.
   - The right one is less detailed and lacks texture sharpness.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
