Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object clearly resembles a lamp with a visible structure including a lampshade and base, corresponding well to "A black lamp." The right object lacks distinguishable features of a lamp.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a solid and natural appearance with proper lamp proportions. The right object appears abstract and lacks a clear lamp structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows proper alignment between texture and shape with a coherent lamp form. The right object does not exhibit clear geometrical features aligning with a lamp.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object maintains detailed and coherent textures that match a lamp's appearance. The right one appears blurred and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object shows clear geometric detail corresponding to a lamp, while the right object lacks meaningful structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object consistently aligns with the prompt and possesses natural and well-detailed features of a lamp.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
