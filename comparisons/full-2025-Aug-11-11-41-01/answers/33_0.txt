Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears dark with some wood-like elements, while the right one is closer to a white table with a consistent color. The right one is better aligned with the "white table" prompt.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid; the right model has irregular leg shapes and proportions. The left one looks more natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has a coherent structure matching its visible surfaces, while the right model's geometry and texture misalign, especially on the legs. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has a basic texture appearance, but the right one does not capture fine details, appearing blurry. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model maintains better structure and detail on close inspection in the normal maps. The right model lacks this detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model provides a better balance of structure, detail, and plausibility, despite not fully matching the color prompt.
The left one is better.
