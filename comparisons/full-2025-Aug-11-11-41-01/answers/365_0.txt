Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a yellow object that resembles a cat but lacks detail and clear form.
   - The right one is a sofa with a pattern that might include some yellow, but the color does not clearly match "white."
   - Based on alignment with the prompt "A yellow cat on a white sofa," the left one (a cat) aligns better with the "yellow cat" part of the prompt, and the right one aligns better with the "sofa" part, though not clearly "white."
   - The right one is better, as it more closely resembles a recognizable sofa structure.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has a more abstract form that lacks solidity and detail.
   - The right one appears more like a complete and coherent 3D model with defined shapes and structures typical of a sofa.
   - The right one is better, as it is more normal, solid, and plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has less clear and detailed texture, appearing more abstract.
   - The right one has a more defined texture, with clearer patterns and details visible on the pillows and sofa fabric.
   - The right one is better with sharper, more realistic texture.
