Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a white background with golden patterns, but includes additional colors like purple and red that are not in the prompt.
   - The right model closely matches the text, showcasing a white vase with golden patterns, and minimal extraneous colors.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears to have more irregularities and the patterns look less defined.
   - The right model looks more structured and cohesive, representing a solid vase with plausible 3D form.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture seems less sharp, with softer patterns.
   - The right model offers sharper, more detailed texture and a more realistic appearance.
   The right one is better.
