Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a rectangular tabletop and traditional four-legged design, aligning well with the concept of a table.
   - The right one has a round tabletop and a single pedestal base, which is less typical for a generic "table" prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have a stable structure with appropriate proportions for a four-legged table.
   - The right one has an unusual pedestal support structure that seems less stable and somewhat irregular.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows more detailed textures, especially on the legs and edges, even though they are slightly noisy.
   - The right one appears smoother and lacks detailed textural information.
   - The left one is better.
