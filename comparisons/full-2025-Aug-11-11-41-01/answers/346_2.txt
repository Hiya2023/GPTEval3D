Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a brown sofa with black stripes that are visible and consistent, matching well with the prompt.
   - The right one also appears as a brown sofa with black stripes, but has additional pillows and less consistent striping.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid and well-formed overall without visible structural issues.
   - The right one appears to have a more complex structure but doesn't show significant body problems or strange features.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a somewhat softer texture that lacks sharpness.
   - The right one displays sharper, more vivid details and textures.
   - The right one is better.
