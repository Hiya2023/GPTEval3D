Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object resembles a typical dresser shape with drawers that are clearly defined; the right object has a more complex shape and ornate design, which may not fit a basic "brown dresser" description. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a simpler, more straightforward design similar to real-world dressers, while the right one, despite being intricate, appears more stylized and less practical. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object’s textures align well with its geometry, showing clear drawer structures. The right object’s textures are more ornate but appear mismatched with the complex shapes. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right object exhibits rich, detailed textures with ornate designs, while the left object has simpler textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The right object demonstrates intricate detailing in geometry that stands out, despite some complexity. The left object maintains simplicity with less detail. The right one is better.

6. Overall considering all factors, the left maintains better alignment with the prompt for a straightforward "brown dresser" and appears more practical, while the right has more texture and detail. The left one is better.
