Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one uses varied colors and patterns but does incorporate some purple elements with questionable white legs.
   - The right one clearly uses purple for the chair and has white legs.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a complex design but appears inconsistent and noisy.
   - The right one appears to be a more solid, realistic chair design.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has mismatched textures and chaotic RGB-normal alignment.
   - The right one shows better correspondence between texture and shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one is detailed but cluttered and lacks clarity.
   - The right one has cleaner and more coherent textures.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has intricate geometry that is often noisy.
   - The right one has smooth, well-defined geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right model consistently outperforms in alignment, realism, and clarity.
   - The right one is better.
