Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one has a predominantly purple and white color with some golden bands, and floral patterns, which deviates from the text prompt "A white vase with golden patterns."
   - The right one exhibits white and blue colors with golden patterns, aligning more closely with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears structurally solid but has complex, busy patterns that may seem less plausible.
   - The right one looks more cohesive and has a more traditional vase-like appearance.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has intricate patterns but lacks sharpness and detail.
   - The right one shows clearer and more defined patterns.
   - The right one is better.
