I'm unable to display the result directly from images, but I can guide you on how to analyze them:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (object 1):** The left object appears somewhat like a table with a flat top and a single central leg, resembling a simplistic table form. However, the details are rough and not clearly defined.
   - **Right (object 2):** The right object has a more defined structure with a top and a central pedestal. It looks more like a traditional table shape but has extraneous elements and colors.

   **The right one is better** due to its closer resemblance to a table.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (object 1):** The structure appears coherent but lacks detail, looking more like a basic form without distinct features.
   - **Right (object 2):** More complex in structure, seemingly more like a complete object, but it may contain unnecessary features or noise.

   **The right one is better** because it seems more finished and solid as a 3D model, despite additional features.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (object 1):** The texture is quite uniform and lacks detail, appearing somewhat grainy or rough.
   - **Right (object 2):** Displays a more detailed, colorful texture, which seems more realistic and defined.

   **The right one is better** due to its sharper and more detailed texture.
