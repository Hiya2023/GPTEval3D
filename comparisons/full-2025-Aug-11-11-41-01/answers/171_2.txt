Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model is a clear yellow sofa with distinct cushions, closely matching the prompt.
   - The right model appears abstract and lacks clear sofa features or color significance.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has well-defined, plausible sofa shapes.
   - The right model looks more abstract with less defined real-world structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model’s texture follows the sofa’s structure well.
   - The right model’s texture appears noisy and misaligned with the structure.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model shows detailed and coherent textures.
   - The right model’s textures seem inconsistent and blurred.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model shows defined geometry and structure.
   - The right model has less refined shapes with noise.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model consistently performs better across all criteria.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
