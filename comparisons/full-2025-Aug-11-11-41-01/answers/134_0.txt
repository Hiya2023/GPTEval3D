Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model is a simple brown sofa, matching the brown part of the prompt but lacks black stripes.
   - The right model has more detail, including black stripes and additional patterns not specified in the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and consistent in shape.
   - The right model has extra pillows and patterns, which might not be as plausible for the text prompt.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model has simple, consistent textures that align with its shape.
   - The right model's textures are more complex but align with its corresponding geometry.
   - Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's textures are plain but clear, aligning with a simple aesthetic.
   - The right model's textures are detailed and varied, despite being busy.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has smoother geometry and less noise.
   - The right model has more detailed geometry, including extra elements like pillows.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering the overall assessment, the right model captures more of the prompt's details and exhibits detailed texture and geometry.
   - The right one is better.
