Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object has a white base with golden patterns, although the surface appears slightly rough and not uniformly white. 
   - The right object has a clear white base with distinctive golden accents and additional colorful patterns.
   - The right one is better as it matches the "white vase with golden patterns" description more closely.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid, though some parts seem uneven, affecting the normal rendering.
   - The right object has a plausible shape with consistent curves and well-defined structure, making it seem more realistic.
   - The right one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a rough texture but with visible detail.
   - The right object showcases sharper, more detailed textures and vibrant colors, enhancing its realism.
   - The right one is better in terms of low-level texture.
