Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left: The table is darker and not white, failing to meet the "white table" description.
   - Right: The table is white, aligning better with the prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: The table appears solid but does not reflect accurate color.
   - Right: The table appears more solid and plausible due to appropriate coloring.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - Left: The texture appears misaligned given the darker appearance.
   - Right: The texture aligns well with the geometry, resembling a white table.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - Left: Texture details are dark and not well-defined.
   - Right: The texture appears clearer and more aligned with being cohesive.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - Left: Details are overshadowed by the darkness.
   - Right: Geometry details are more visible and structured.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   The right one better matches the prompt, represents plausible 3D structure, and aligns textures and geometry effectively.
   The right one is better.
