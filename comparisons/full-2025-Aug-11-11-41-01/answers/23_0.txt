Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a solid yellow color, directly reflecting the prompt. The right object includes multiple colors and patterns, not adhering strictly to "yellow." 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more amorphous and less defined, while the right object shows clear sofa characteristics like cushions and legs.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object has a consistent yellow texture that matches its shape. The right objectâ€™s textures are more complex and correspond accurately to the sofa details.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object misses fine details, appearing flat. The right object has intricate patterns and depth.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The normal maps of the left object are less detailed and less structured compared to the distinct features in the right object.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right object captures more aspects of a plausible, detailed sofa, though it strays in prompt color.
The right one is better.
