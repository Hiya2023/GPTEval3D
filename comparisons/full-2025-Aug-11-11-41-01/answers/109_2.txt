Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has an abstract shape, not resembling a desk; the right one clearly represents a desk with drawers and brass handles.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears abstract and lacks coherent structure; the right one has more realistic proportions and details.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows misalignment with textures not matching shapes; the right one displays a better alignment between textures and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks detail and appears more blurred; the right one has distinct textures and decorative patterns.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows irregular geometry; the right one has well-defined and intricate details like drawers and handles.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one effectively represents the prompt with plausible geometry and texture alignment.
The right one is better.
