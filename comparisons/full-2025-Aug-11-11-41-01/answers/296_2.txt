Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1):** Features a grey dog but lacks any visible green bicycle.
   - **Right (object 2):** Also shows a grey dog with no green bicycle visible.

Both models contain the grey dog but fail to display the green bicycle as per the text prompt. 

Cannot decide as neither accurately reflects the full text description.

Final answer:
3
