Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a more balanced integration of blue and yellow colors, closely fitting the description "blue and yellow bowl." The right object also uses these colors but appears more jumbled. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more solid with consistent proportions; the right one has irregular shapes and less natural structure. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture in the left object aligns more consistently with its geometry; the right object shows mismatches. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has discernible patterns without excessive blurring, whereas the right object suffers from overlapped textures. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits a smoother shape without noise. The right one shows irregularities and roughness. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object is generally more accurate and visually aligned with the prompt requirements. The left one is better.

Final answer:
