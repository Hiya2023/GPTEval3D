Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left chair has a cohesive purple body and distinctly white legs, closely aligning with the prompt. The right chair has a less defined color transition and unclear leg color. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left chair appears natural and solid with consistent shapes, whereas the right chair has disproportionate features and looks less realistic.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left chair shows a better alignment between texture and geometry, with consistent purple color and shape. The right chair has mismatched textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left chair captures fine details clearly without blurriness. The right chair's texture is less defined and appears abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left chair's normal map displays clear and smooth geometry details. The right chair's geometry is less organized and includes noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left chair is consistently better in meeting the prompt and 3D model quality.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
