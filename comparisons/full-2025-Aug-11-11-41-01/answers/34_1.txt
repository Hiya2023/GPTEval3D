Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model exhibits more colors and is less uniform, while the right model adheres more closely to the prompt of "a white table."
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model shows uneven and distorted geometry making it less plausible. The right model has a more consistent and solid shape.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture is misaligned with its geometry. The right model presents better alignment between texture and shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has colorful and inconsistent textures, whereas the right model maintains a more uniform detail level.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model is less organized, with visible noise; the right model presents smoother and more coherent details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, based on the above evaluations, the right model aligns more closely with criteria.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
