Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one depicts a white table accurately reflecting the prompt; The right one shows a multicolored table not matching the description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows a simple, plausible structure; The right one has added complexity but is less believable as a white table.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with its geometry, maintaining simplicity; The right one's texture does not match its multicolored appearance with its structure.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one maintains clarity in its simplicity; The right one displays an undesired complex texture.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smooth, simple geometry fitting the prompt; The right one has unnecessary complexity.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object aligns better with the prompt and is more plausible as a white table.
The left one is better.
