Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is red, matching the prompt; the right one is green.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one seems less natural with irregularities. The right one appears more solid.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has some visible texture misalignments. The right one has better alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears blurry. The right one captures more details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has noisy structures. The right one shows more defined geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering color accuracy and plausibility, the right one addresses more criteria effectively.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
1 2 2 2 2 2
