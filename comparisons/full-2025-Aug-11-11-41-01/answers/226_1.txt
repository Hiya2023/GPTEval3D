Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) features a pink vase with a reflective, somewhat abstract texture. There is no visible shelf in the images.
   - The right one (object 2) displays a vase with a predominantly blue and brown pattern, missing the pink color prominent in the text prompt. There is no visible shelf in the images.
   
The left one is better since it aligns more closely with the "pink vase" aspect of the prompt.

Final answer:
