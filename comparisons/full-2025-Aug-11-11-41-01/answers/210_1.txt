Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1): The desk is turquoise, with distinct handles visible, which might be represented as brass, aligning with the text prompt. The shape resembles a classic desk.
   - The right one (object 2): While the object is turquoise, the structure seems more abstract and not as clearly desk-like. The legs appear ornate, suggesting they might be brass, but the clarity and alignment to a traditional desk are lacking.

The left one is better.

Final answer:
