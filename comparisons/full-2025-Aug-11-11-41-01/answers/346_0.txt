Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a predominantly brown color with black stripes, matching the text prompt.
   - The right one has brown and black striped textures and additional decorative elements like pillows.
   - Both correspond well to the text prompt, but the left one is more straightforward in aligning with "brown sofa with black stripes."
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is uniformly textured and appears more solid and cohesive in structure.
   - The right one appears plausible but has additional elements that might distract from the core structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has clean, distinct striped textures but appears more simplified.
   - The right one shows varied textures and more details, including cushions with patterns.
   - The right one is better.
