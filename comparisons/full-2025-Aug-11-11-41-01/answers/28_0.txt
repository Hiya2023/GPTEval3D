   - The left one includes a plant and some surroundings, but the window is not clear.
   - The right one depicts a plant but lacks the window context.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has some irregular features but appears more solid overall.
   - The right one appears less natural with more noticeable irregularities.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows better alignment between texture and shape.
   - The right one's texture does not align well with its geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures more detail without significant blurring.
   - The right one appears less detailed and somewhat blurry.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows more organized geometry without noise.
   - The right one has less organized shape and more noise.
