Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left bowl features stripes of blue and yellow, matching the prompt's description effectively.
   - The right bowl also has blue and yellow stripes but includes additional pattern details.
   - Both align well with the prompt, but the right one adds extra decorative elements.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left bowl appears solid and well-structured with a smooth form.
   - The right bowl seems slightly more complex but still plausible without any obvious structural errors.
   - Both are plausible, but the left one appears more straightforward and cohesive.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left bowl's texture appears smoother and more uniform.
   - The right bowl has a more varied texture, but it's less sharp.
   - The left bowl has more detailed and realistic textures.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
