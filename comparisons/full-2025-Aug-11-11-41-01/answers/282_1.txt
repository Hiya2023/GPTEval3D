Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: The chair has a predominantly purple pattern with some additional colors and white elements on the legs, but it does not fully align with the description of being simply purple with white legs.
   - **Right (object 2)**: The chair clearly has a solid purple seat and back with white legs, precisely matching the text description.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
