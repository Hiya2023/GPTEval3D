Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one clearly depicts a red car that aligns with the text prompt, but there's no visible beige house.
   - The right one shows a red car beside what looks like the suggestion of a house structure, which is closer to the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a solid structure but lacks surroundings, limiting real-world context.
   - The right one appears less cohesive and has more visual noise, affecting its plausibility.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother texture with less detail.
   - The right one contains more detailed textures but appears noisy and chaotic.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
