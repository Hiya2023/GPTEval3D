Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features a black vase while the right model shows a brown table. Both capture part of the prompt, but together they meet the full description. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left vase appears more solid and natural compared to the right table, which looks slightly flat. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The vase on the left shows better alignment between texture and geometry compared to the table on the right. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left vase presents clearer texture details, while the right table seems to lack fine detail. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The normal map of the vase on the left displays more intricate details than the table on the right. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model captures important aspects better and presents a more visually coherent object. The left one is better.
