Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one closely resembles the text prompt, displaying a straightforward yellow sofa. The right one has a patterned texture, deviating from the plain description. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more solid and plausible with natural proportions. The right one appears more ornate but less realistic in terms of structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model aligns well with a simple and clear texture, matching its geometry. The right one shows a mismatch between its patterned texture and the sofa form.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures fine details accurately without being blurry, while the right one’s texture is more intricate but doesn’t reflect the prompt’s simplicity.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a more coherent and organized structure without noise, while the right has more decorative but less consistent details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model aligns more closely with the text prompt and exhibits better 3D features.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
