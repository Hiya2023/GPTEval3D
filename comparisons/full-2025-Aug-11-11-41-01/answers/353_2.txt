Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear white vase with distinct golden patterns, fitting the prompt well.
   - The right one has a more complex pattern that appears scattered and less distinct.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid with a plausible vase shape.
   - The right one seems to have noisy structures and an irregular form.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has smoother texture transitions and visible patterns.
   - The right one appears more detailed but potentially too noisy.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
