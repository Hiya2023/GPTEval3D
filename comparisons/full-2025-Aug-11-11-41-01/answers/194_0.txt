Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model shows a table but lacks a vase. The right model depicts a vase on what appears to be a table, aligning better with the "A black vase on a brown table" prompt. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model shows a more natural table structure. The right model’s vase and table appear merged and less realistic in terms of proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: In the left model, the table's shape and texture align well. The right model has mismatched and distorted textures, affecting the vase’s appearance.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clearer and more coherent textures. The right model is noisy and has abstract textures that don't align with realistic details.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's table displays more structured details. The right model lacks clear geometric details due to distorted elements.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model better adheres to the 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, texture details, and geometric details, though it does not align with the initial text prompt as well as the right one.
The left one is better.
