Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one shows an object resembling a chair and a ball, while the right one shows only a ball. 
   - The left one better matches the description of "a red ball under a blue chair."
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears to have more objects and complexity but looks less natural due to overlapping structures. 
   - The right model, with a simple ball, appears more solid and plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's textures do not fit well with the geometry, showing mismatches and irregularities.
   - The right model has a consistent appearance between RGB and normal maps.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's textures are inconsistent and blurry in places.
   - The right model shows clear and consistent textures.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has noisy and disorganized geometric details.
   - The right model shows smooth and coherent geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering the above criteria, the right model with the simpler shape and better texture and geometry alignment is superior.
   - The right one is better.
