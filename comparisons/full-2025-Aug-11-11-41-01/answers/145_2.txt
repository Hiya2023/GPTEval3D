Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is blue with patterns, while the right one is predominantly white with gold patterns. The right one aligns better with the prompt of "A white vase with golden patterns."
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one has a more regular and solid form, while the right one appears uneven and less natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one's texture aligns well with its geometry, while the right one shows some misalignment with texture not adhering well to the vase shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one has clear patterns but mismatched colors, and the right one, although aligning with the prompt color-wise, has less sharp pattern details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one has more consistent geometry details, while the right one's shape appears uneven and less refined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria above, the left one has better geometry and texture alignment, but the right one adheres to the text prompt more accurately.
The left one is better.
