Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one correctly depicts a defined sofa structure with a noticeable yellow aspect, though mixed with blue, aligning more closely with the text prompt.
   - The right one appears as a vague shape with more roughness and less clear sofa definition. 
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one shows a more identifiable sofa shape with better proportions, though some color inaccuracies are present.
   - The right one lacks a clear structure, appearing less like a sofa.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one illustrates a sofa design where the texture seems to better align with the shape.
   - The right one's texture does not resemble any defined sofa features.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one has clearer patterns and textures resembling a sofa.
   - The right one is too abstract and lacks recognizable texture.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one presents more structured, coherent sofa shapes in the normal maps.
   - The right one displays noisy geometry with little to no articulable structure.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns more closely with the criteria and prompt.
   - The left one is better.
