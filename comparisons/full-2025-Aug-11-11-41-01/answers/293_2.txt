Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a nondescript object with unclear features. It doesn't show any distinct sofa-like structure or visible colors that match the description.
   - The right one clearly depicts a sofa with visible brown and black striped patterns, aligning well with the text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
