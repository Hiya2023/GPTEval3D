Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a simple white table with basic leg structure; the right object also represents a white table but with more complex detailing on the leg. The left one better reflects the simplicity of the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object looks solid and plausible with realistic proportions; the right object has complex but precarious leg details that seem less stable.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object’s texture aligns well with its simple shape; the right object’s texture is more complex but can appear mismatched at times.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object effectively captures a uniform texture suitable for a simple table; the right object’s details are more pronounced but may be unnecessary.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has well-organized, smooth geometry; the right object’s intricate details add complexity but not necessarily more realism.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object better represents the simplicity of "a white table" in all aspects.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
