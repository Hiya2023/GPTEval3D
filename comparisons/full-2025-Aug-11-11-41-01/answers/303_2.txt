Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a green bicycle but has significant color anomalies with magenta parts.
   - The right model is clearly a green bicycle with more accurate alignment to the description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks distorted and less plausible as a solid bicycle.
   - The right model is more coherent and resembles a real bicycle structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has noisy and inaccurate textures.
   - The right model's textures are sharper and more detailed.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
