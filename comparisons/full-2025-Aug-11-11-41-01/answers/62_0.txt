Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left chair has a patterned cushion which deviates from the solid purple description, while the legs are white. The right chair aligns more closely with a simple purple design and white legs.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left chair has a more complex, though less plausible structure due to unclear textures, while the right chair appears more natural and solid.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left chair shows mismatched patterns, whereas the right one maintains consistency between geometry and texture.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left chairâ€™s texture is unclear and noisy, while the right chair maintains clarity in its texture.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left chair's geometry is noisy and less defined. The right chair presents more smooth and organized details.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right chair consistently performs better across all criteria.
   The right one is better.
