Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a purple chair with a floral pattern and white legs, aligning well with "A purple chair with white legs."
   - The right one is a solid purple chair with darker legs, which only partially matches the description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and plausible with clear, well-formed parts.
   - The right one is solid but has uneven textures on the legs.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed and clear textures, especially with the floral pattern.
   - The right one has a less detailed texture, appearing more uniform and less intricate.
   - The left one is better.
