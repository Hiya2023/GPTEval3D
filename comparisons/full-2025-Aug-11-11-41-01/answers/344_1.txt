Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model includes a plant in a pot but lacks a clear depiction of a window.
   - The right model shows leaves but doesnâ€™t depict a pot or window.
   - The left one is better for including the pot, making it closer to the "green plant beside a white window" prompt even if the window is missing.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more solid and plausible with a more defined structure, despite no window.
   - The right model consists of only leaves, which may seem less plausible as a standalone object relating to the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has some texture detail on the pot and leaves.
   - The right model has less detail overall.
   - The left one is better.
