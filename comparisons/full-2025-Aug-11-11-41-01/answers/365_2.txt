Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears as an abstract shape with no clear features of a cat or sofa. 
   - The right model clearly depicts a sofa with pillows, aligning more closely with the description of a "white sofa," but it doesn't show a cat.
   
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model seems abstract and distorted with fluid-like shapes that are not plausible for a cat or a sofa.
   - The right model looks like a solid, recognizable sofa, making it more plausible.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model lacks detailed textures and appears uniformly yellow.
   - The right model exhibits more detailed textures, especially in the patterns of the sofa and pillows.
   
   The right one is better.
