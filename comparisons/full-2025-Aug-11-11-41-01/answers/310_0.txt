Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1):** The left object is fragmented and doesn't resemble a cushion shape, making it difficult to align with the text prompt.
   - **Right (object 2):** The right object clearly resembles a cushion and aligns well with the colors "pink and grey" in the prompt.
   - **Decision:** Right is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (object 1):** The left object appears as disjointed elements without a solid form, lacking in plausibility.
   - **Right (object 2):** The right object looks like a normal, solid cushion, appearing more plausible as a 3D model.
   - **Decision:** Right is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (object 1):** The texture is not discernible due to the fragmented nature of the object.
   - **Right (object 2):** The right object has a discernible texture with detail and sharpness that resembles fabric.
   - **Decision:** Right is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
