Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model looks like a traditional four-legged table with a colorful top, which does not match the "white table" prompt.
   - The right model appears to have a single central column with a round top, which also lacks the "white" aspect.

   Cannot decide as neither aligns with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks more coherent and structurally sound as a typical table design.
   - The right model has an unusual base which looks less stable and realistic.

   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has more detailed textures with colors, despite not being necessary for a white table.
   - The right model lacks texture details and appears more washed out.

   The left one is better.

Final answer:
