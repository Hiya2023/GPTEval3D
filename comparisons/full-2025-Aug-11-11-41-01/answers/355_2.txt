Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one resembles a simplistic form with a flatter top and a single support, suggesting a basic table structure but lacking detail.
   - The right one has more distinct features that align more with common table characteristics, like a more detailed stand and a round top, potentially with textures representing a tabletop design.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have a basic, less complex structure that might be more stable but lacks detail.
   - The right one shows a more intricate design with potential legs and base, appearing structurally plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a simple, less detailed texture.
   - The right one shows more texture detail, with variations suggesting a more realistic surface.
   - The right one is better.
