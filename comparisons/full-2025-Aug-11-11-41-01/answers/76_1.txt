Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one lacks the black color specified in the prompt, and the right one does not resemble a lamp at all. However, the left one at least captures the form of a lamp. 
Left is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one presents a more plausible lamp shape with distinct components, while the right lacks a recognizable structure. 
Left is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left model is more coherent with its shape compared to the right one, which lacks any defined form.
Left is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows more detailed texturing, while the right lacks discernible texture due to its ambiguous form.
Left is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a more structured geometry, while the right remains amorphous and lacks definition.
Left is better.

6. Overall, based on all the criteria evaluated, the left one is decisively better.

Final answer:
