Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a white table; the right one has a colorful texture and doesn't align with the prompt. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks multiple legs which makes it implausible; the right one has a typical table structure. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has consistent color with geometry; the right one has mismatched textures. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is simple but correctly colored; the right one has noisy and colorful aberrations. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is minimal but smooth; the right one has more detail but with noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering adherence to the prompt, and consistency, the left one fulfills the requirements better.

Final answer:
