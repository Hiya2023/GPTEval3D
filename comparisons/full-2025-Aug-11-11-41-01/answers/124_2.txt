Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one depicts a traditional table with four legs, corresponding well to a "table"; the right one has an unconventional single leg design. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a standard table design, whereas the right one looks unstable with a single leg. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows alignments between texture and legs; the right one has a mismatch with textures not covering the geometry properly. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows more detailed textures, like wood grain; the right one is less detailed and blurry. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has clear leg definitions and edges; the right one's geometry is less refined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left object aligns better in all aspects and is more accurate to the prompt.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
