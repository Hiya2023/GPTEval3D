Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears to have an abstract table structure with a simplistic design, while the right one resembles a realistic table with well-defined legs and structure. The prompt describes "A white table," and the right one captures a complete table better, although the color isn't white, it reflects the structure more accurately. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks less plausible with unstable and unnatural proportions, while the right model displays a more realistic table design with appropriate proportions and structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture appears simplistic and misaligned, with no distinct table features. The right model shows better texture alignment with its geometry, as it adheres to the legs and tabletop.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model lacks texture detail, making it appear flat and unfinished. The right model has more intricate texture details representing wood grain on the table surface, despite incorrect coloring.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model is simplistic and lacks detail. The right model has more refined geometry, reflected in the table legs and surfaces.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model shows a closer resemblance to a table in terms of structure, plausibility, texture, and detail, despite not matching the white color specified in the prompt. 
The right one is better.
