Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object is uniformly brown, matching the "brown sofa" part of the prompt but lacks clear black stripes.
   - The right object includes both brown and black stripes, aligning well with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears more solid and natural in shape.
   - The right object has some irregularities in structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture aligns well with its geometry, creating a coherent structure.
   - The right object shows misalignment with stripes not following the contours.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has fine details but appears slightly blurred.
   - The right object has clearer textures and details.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has smoother and more organized geometry.
   - The right object displays some noisy structures.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the left object better balances texture and 3D form, except for alignment with the text prompt.
   - The left one is better.
