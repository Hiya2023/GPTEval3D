Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is blue, with some yellow patterns; the right one is fully yellow-green. The right one better matches the prompt for "A yellow sofa".
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left sofa has a defined shape and structure; the right one appears less structured and amorphous.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s texture aligns well with the sofa's shape, while textures on the right model look noisy and misaligned.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model shows clear details and patterns; the right one has blurry, undefined texture.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model displays well-defined geometry; the right model's geometry appears noisy and less organized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, based on alignment with the prompt and 3D plausibility, the left model offers a more coherent representation, despite the color mismatch.
The left one is better.
