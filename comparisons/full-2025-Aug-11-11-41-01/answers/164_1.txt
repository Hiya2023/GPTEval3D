Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear desk shape and visible brass handles, matching the description well.
   - The right one has a more abstract shape with indistinct features, making it hard to identify specific elements like handles.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a defined desk structure resembling a real desk.
   - The right one appears irregular and does not convey a plausible desk shape.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has textures that align well with its geometric shape, depicting a desk with handles.
   - The right one lacks coherent alignment between textures and geometry, making it look unrealistic.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one shows detailed textures, especially in the handles and desk surface.
   - The right one appears blurry and lacks fine details in its texture.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has a clearer and more structured geometry that fits the description of a desk.
   - The right one appears abstract and lacks organized geometric details.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left one aligns with the prompt better and depicts a more realistic and detailed representation of a desk with brass handles.
   - The left one is better.
