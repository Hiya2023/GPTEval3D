Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model features a yellow cat and includes surroundings that appear less defined. The textures and color indicate a cat on a surface, but the details of the sofa are unclear.
   - The right model shows a yellow cat clearly placed on a white sofa. The details of the fur and the sofa are clearer, and the positioning aligns well with the text description.

The right one is better.
