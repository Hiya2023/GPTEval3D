Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears black and resembles a lamp. The right one does not look like a lamp and the color is off.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more like a simple lamp with plausible structure. The right one seems like an abstract object with non-lamp features.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s texture aligns with a lamp shape; the right one’s texture does not correspond to a typical lamp geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has coherent textures for a simple lamp, while the right one’s details are not meaningful for a lamp.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one retains simplicity consistent with a lamp, whereas the right one’s geometry has unnecessary complexities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object is a more accurate depiction of "a black lamp" in all criteria.
The left one is better.
