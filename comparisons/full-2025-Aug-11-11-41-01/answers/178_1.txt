Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one does not clearly show the sofa's shape or colors; the texture is ambiguous.
   - The right one displays a clearer brown sofa with discernible black stripes.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears amorphous and lacks solidity.
   - The right one shows more natural and solid proportions.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one lacks clear structure alignment between geometry and texture.
   - The right one's texture aligns reasonably well with its geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has very blurry textures.
   - The right one's textures are more defined and capture details better.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one exhibits unstructured and noisy geometry.
   - The right one has more coherent and smooth geometrical details.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one is better in each reviewed aspect and better aligns with the prompt.
