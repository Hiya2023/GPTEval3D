Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left 3D object (object 1) is a bowl predominantly blue with a hint of yellow. The colors are relatively subdued and there is less contrast.
   - The right 3D object (object 2) features more distinct blue and yellow striping, which is more aligned with the prompt "A blue and yellow bowl" due to its clear depiction of both colors.

The right one is better in terms of color accuracy and alignment with the prompt.

Final answer:
2
