Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model accurately features a blue chair, though the desk is missing.
   - The right model displays a patterned chair without matching the color requirement, and the desk is missing.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has realistic proportions and resembles an office chair.
   - The right model, while detailed, has exaggerated features that look less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture aligns well with the geometry, showing a cohesive structure.
   - The right model's texture does not align well due to its abstract pattern.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's texture is simple but consistent with expectations.
   - The right model has complex textures that are too stylized for the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has clear and well-defined geometry.
   - The right model's geometry appears more ornate but not as fitting for the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects:
   - The left model better fulfills the criteria given in the task.
   - The left one is better.
