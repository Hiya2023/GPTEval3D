Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a vague shape and lacks clear features corresponding to a sofa.
   - The right one resembles a sofa with discernible features and some patterning that might be interpreted as stripes.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears highly abstract and lacks solidity or definition.
   - The right one is more structured and resembles a plausible sofa.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has poor texture detail and lacks clarity.
   - The right one shows more detailed textures, with clearer patterns.
   - The right one is better.
