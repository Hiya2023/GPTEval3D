Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a floral pattern with visible pink and grey hues, more akin to a cushion's appearance.
   - The right one has fragmented and less coherent structures, making it hard to identify as a cushion.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows a solid, cohesive shape consistent with a cushion.
   - The right one appears fragmented and lacks a plausible structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a clear floral texture with distinguishable details.
   - The right one lacks coherent texture details and appears more abstract.
   - The left one is better.
