Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has a floral pattern that does not match the prompt description of a "brown sofa with black stripes."
   - The right model accurately reflects a brown sofa although it lacks distinct black stripes.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model has distorted geometry owing to the pattern, affecting the plausibility.
   - The right model appears more natural and solid overall.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left model shows misalignment between the floral texture and the sofa shape.
   - The right model shows good alignment with consistent brown texture throughout.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model's textures appear busy and unclear.
   - The right model captures more coherent texture details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left model exhibits uneven geometry possibly due to the pattern distortion.
   - The right model has smoother and better-organized geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: 
   - The right model consistently reflects the criteria better.
   The right one is better.
