Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model is more floral in appearance, lacking clear black stripes; the right model has a clear brown color with black stripes. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears less sofa-like and more like a textured block, while the right model appears more like a realistic sofa. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture does not align well with sofa geometry, while the right model's stripes follow the sofa's shape nicely. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model shows floral patterns that are neither striped nor clear; the right one has more precise striping details. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a less structured and coherent geometry, while the right model has more defined forms and details. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one accurately depicts the text description and exhibits better modeling characteristics. The right one is better.
