Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model better reflects the "white table" with its clear rectangular shape and leg design, despite the color mismatch. The right model lacks accurate structure and does not resemble a table. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and table-like with distinct legs and a flat top. The right model has unrealistic proportions and a less plausible structure. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better alignment between geometry and texture, with both resembling a table structure. The right model's geometry does not align well, appearing disjointed. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model maintains finer detail along the surface, despite color inaccuracy. The right model lacks detail and is oversimplified. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more organized geometry with visible table features, while the right is irregular and lacks detail. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model performs better in accurately representing a "white table."
The left one is better.
