Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left one has disjointed pink and grey areas that don't form a cohesive cushion shape.
   - The right one represents a cushion with clear floral patterns in pink and grey, matching the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left one appears fragmented and lacks the solidity of a typical cushion.
   - The right one is solid and visually consistent in representing a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left one lacks detailed textures and appears abstract.
   - The right one features sharp, detailed floral patterns consistent with a realistic cushion.
   - The right one is better.
