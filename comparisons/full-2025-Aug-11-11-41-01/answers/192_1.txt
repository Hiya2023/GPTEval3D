Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has brown legs instead of white; the right one accurately reflects the purple chair with white legs.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows some unrealistic features like the leg color; the right one has more natural body proportions and structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has some misalignment with its texture on the legs; the right one has a more cohesive texture adherence.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has some blurriness on the fabric texture; the right one shows finer texture detail.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is less smooth and has some disorganized structures; the right one shows a more organized and intricate geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all aspects, the right one is more accurate to the prompt and better in texture and geometry details.
The right one is better.
