Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) has a more defined texture and shape reminiscent of a typical armchair. The color and form align well with the "orange armchair" text prompt. It presents a clear and coherent silhouette from multiple angles.
   - The right one (object 2), while also orange, has a more complex texture that obscures the armchair form, making it harder to discern as an armchair. The intricate surface details might detract from a clear representation of an "armchair."

The left one is better.

Final answer:
