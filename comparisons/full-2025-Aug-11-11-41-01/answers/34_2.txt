Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model seems more complex and less aligned with the simplicity implied by "a white table."
   - The right model has a simpler structure, closer to the idea of a table.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more abstract with more structural irregularities.
   - The right model looks more solid and plausible as a table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model has a more complex texture that doesn't align well with the geometry.
   - The right model features better alignment between geometry and texture.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's texture looks more abstract and less table-like.
   - The right model's texture is cleaner and aligns with a typical table surface.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model seems to have unnecessary complexity and noise.
   - The right model has a straightforward, efficient structure.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right model consistently aligns better with the criteria of a simple, plausible table.
   - The right one is better.
