Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features a more ornate dresser, though it lacks clear definition; The right one presents a simple, clear brown dresser.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows irregular shapes and proportions; The right one has more cohesive and realistic structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s texture does not align with the form; The right one’s texture is in better harmony with the dresser’s shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one’s textures are more abstract; The right one’s textures are clearer and well-defined.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits uneven geometry; The right one maintains smoother and more organized details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering accuracy, realism, and detail, the right one performs better across all categories.
The right one is better.
