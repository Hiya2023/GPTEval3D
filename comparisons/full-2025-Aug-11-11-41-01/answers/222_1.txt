Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (1) resembles a classic armchair with a clear orange color and defined shape, closely aligning with the "orange armchair" prompt. The texture appears consistent with typical upholstery, and the overall structure fits an armchair description.
   - The right object (2) also matches the armchair shape but features more exaggerated textures and a pattern that may be less typical for a simple description. While it still fits the armchair description, its alignment is slightly more abstract.

The left one is better.
