Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one includes a pot, resembling a plant in a pot, while the right one lacks a clear representation of a plant beside a window.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows a more structured plant form, while the right one appears less organized and natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one maintains better alignment between the plant's structure and texture, while the right one shows some misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures sharper texture details, while the right one is less defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows intricate leaf structures, while the right one is less detailed.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model better represents the prompt with a more plausible and detailed structure.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
