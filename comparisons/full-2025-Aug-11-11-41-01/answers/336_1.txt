Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts a plant within a window frame, suggesting alignment with "beside a white window."
   - The right one shows a potted plant without any indication of a window.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows odd distortions in the window frame, impacting its solidity.
   - The right one appears more structurally coherent and plausible as a standalone plant.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one demonstrates more detailed and realistic leaf textures.
   - The right one, while clear, lacks textural detail compared to the left.
   - The left one is better.
