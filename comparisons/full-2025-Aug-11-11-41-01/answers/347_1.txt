Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a rectangular table with four legs, which aligns with the description of a "white table."
   - The right object is an oval table with a central pedestal, which is less common for the typical interpretation of just "a table."
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks structurally plausible as a traditional table.
   - The right object has a reasonable shape for a table, but the base and pedestal look less solid and a bit unusual.
The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture is somewhat rough but appears to have more detail consistent with a wooden table.
   - The right object lacks noticeable texture detail and appears smoother.
The left one is better.
