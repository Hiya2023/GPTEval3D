Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a yellow cat but lacks a clear environment; the right one has a cat missing. The right is better for the sofa detail, but neither fully satisfies the prompt. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less natural with abstract, flat geometry; the right one has a plausible 3D sofa with solid structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left's cat and background show misalignment; the right's sofa texture aligns with geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left has blurry details; the right has clear, distinct textures on the sofa.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left has amorphous shapes; the right has well-defined, smooth geometry for the sofa.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one presents a more cohesive and plausible model despite missing the cat.
The right one is better.
