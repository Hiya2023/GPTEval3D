Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more like a simple dresser with a straightforward rectangular shape and drawers. The right one has a more ornate and complex structure. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a clear, consistent shape like a standard dresser, whereas the right one seems overly complex and less natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better alignment between shape and texture, while the right one appears more chaotic with mismatched texturing.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right one has more intricate textures, but they are overly stylized, which isn't fitting given the prompt.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has clearer, more defined geometric details that resemble a real dresser, while the right one seems too stylized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one more accurately represents the prompt with a plausible, well-aligned, and more realistic structure.
The left one is better.
