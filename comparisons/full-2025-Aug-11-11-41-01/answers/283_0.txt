Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model (object 1) appears to be a yellow sofa with clear details in its structure, including visible cushions. However, the lighting or material may cause the shade to appear slightly off from pure yellow.
   - The right model (object 2) accurately reflects a yellow sofa with a clearer, brighter yellow color, which closely aligns with the text prompt. The shape and details of the sofa are visible but less defined compared to object 1.

The right one is better as it aligns more closely with the color specified in the text prompt.

Final answer:
