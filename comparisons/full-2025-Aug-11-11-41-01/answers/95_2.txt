Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object accurately represents the white sofa and the cat is yellow, but the overall color scheme seems off. The right object has more accurate color alignment with a visible yellow cat and a distinct white sofa. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object shows a more natural and solid structure with consistent proportions. The right object has some distortion in its structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object exhibits better texture adherence to its geometry, as the shapes of the sofa and cat match well in both RGB and normal images. The right object has less consistent alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures finer texture details better without appearing blurry. The right object lacks in clarity.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has more organized and detailed geometry, while the right one shows more noise and irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, based on the above analyses, the left object is more accurate and better executed overall.
The left one is better.
