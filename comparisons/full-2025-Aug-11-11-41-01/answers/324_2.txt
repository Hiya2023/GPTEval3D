Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one (3D Object 1) resembles a black lamp with a clear lampshade, stand, and a base, aligning well with the "black lamp" prompt.
   - The right one (3D Object 2) appears to be a different, non-lamp object, resembling a cylindrical or telescope-like shape, which does not align with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and plausible as a lamp, with no strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right one does not resemble a plausible lamp structure and has an unclear shape with potential meaningless structures.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a relatively consistent and simple texture appropriate for a lamp; however, detailed textures are minimal.
   - The right one has more varied textures and details, potentially more challenging to discern due to its unique shape.
   - The right one is better.
