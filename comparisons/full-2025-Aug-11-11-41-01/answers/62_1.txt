Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left chair has a pattern but also includes colors beyond the prompt description, and the legs aren't distinctively white. The right chair accurately reflects a simple purple chair with white legs.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left chair appears more complex but less realistic with distorted proportions. The right chair has a more natural shape and proportions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left chair's texture does not align well with its geometry, appearing noisy. The right chair has a consistent alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left chair's texture is busy and unclear. The right chair maintains clear, simple texture details that match the prompt.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left chair has noisy and irregular geometry. The right chair has smooth and visually coherent geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right chair better aligns with the prompt and presents a more plausible and coherent model.
The right one is better.
