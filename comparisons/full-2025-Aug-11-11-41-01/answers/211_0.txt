Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- Left (object 1): The left object is a straightforward brown dresser with clean lines and a conventional shape. The texture appears consistent, and the overall structure aligns well with the description of a "brown dresser."

The left one is better in aligning with the simple and clear text prompt.
