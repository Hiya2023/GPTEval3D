Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a detailed design with more ornate and visible handles, accurately matching "a brown dresser" with intricate carvings. The right one is simpler and lacks visible details. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more realistic appearance with well-defined contours and structures. The right one looks flat and less solid. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures align well with its curved and ornate shapes, while the right one's texture appears mismatched with its geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model showcases rich texture details and wood grain, whereas the right one is too simplistic and lacks fine detail. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model includes intricate carvings and curves that align with the dresser shape, while the right is basic and lacks these details. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model captures the text prompt with better detail, plausibility, and alignment. The left one is better.
