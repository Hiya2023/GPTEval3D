Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a more structured desk with drawers and clear handle outlines, fitting the prompt well.
   - The right one has an unusual shape and does not clearly resemble a desk. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more natural with properly shaped components.
   - The right one has distorted proportions and lacks a realistic desk shape.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's textures align with its geometry, showing defined shapes.
   - The right one's textures are not well-aligned, with mismatched patterns.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures fine details in both wood and handles.
   - The right one has blurry and less refined textures.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one exhibits smooth and clear geometric details with minimal noise.
   - The right one displays irregular and noisy details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left one consistently represents the prompt better across all criteria.
   The left one is better.
