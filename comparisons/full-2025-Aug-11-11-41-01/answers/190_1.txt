Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object captures the table and vase accurately, with both significant elements clearly presented. The right object also captures both the table and vase accurately. Both align well with the text prompt.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears natural with plausible proportions and solid structure. The right object also appears natural but seems slightly less solid compared to the left.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: In the left object, textures and geometry align well, showing clear shapes. The right object also shows good alignment, though slightly less precise.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures fine details with clarity. The right object appears slightly blurry in comparison.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits intricate details in the normal maps. The right object is less detailed and slightly noisier.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object provides a stronger representation of the text prompt with better texture, geometry alignment, and detail.
The left one is better.
