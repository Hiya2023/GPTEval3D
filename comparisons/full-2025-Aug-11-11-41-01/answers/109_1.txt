Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a rough, abstract shape with no clear features resembling a desk or brass handles. 
   - The right one clearly shows a desk-like structure with visible drawers and handles resembling brass.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks a realistic desk structure, appearing more like an organic shape.
   - The right one has a structured, believable desk form with drawers and handles.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows inconsistent alignment with mismatched textures and shapes.
   - The right one maintains consistent alignment between texture and geometry, with clear structure lines.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has less distinct details and appears abstract.
   - The right one features distinct and clear texture details on drawers and handles.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one lacks defined geometry; edges and surfaces are not well-formed.
   - The right one shows more defined geometry with visible drawers and edges.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one is coherent with the text prompt, structurally plausible, and has better texture and geometry details.
   - The right one is better.
