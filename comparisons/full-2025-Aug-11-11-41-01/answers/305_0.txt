Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a rectangular table with multicolored textures, which does not align with the "white table" prompt.
   - The right one, although roughly shaped, is closer to a simple round table design, but lacks the specified white color.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model has a more structured and recognizable table shape.
   - The right model looks less stable and structurally coherent.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a detailed, multicolored texture.
   - The right model's texture is less distinct and lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
