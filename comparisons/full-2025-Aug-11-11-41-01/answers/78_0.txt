Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows the red car clearly, but lacks the beige house; the right one also captures the car, but the background is indistinct and lacks the house. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more structured and natural compared to the right, which appears to have a less plausible shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's geometry and texture align better overall; the right one shows some misalignment in shapes.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures more detail in the car's texture; the right is blurrier.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left shows more defined geometry; the right has less detail and smoothness.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more aligned with 3D expectations and details.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1 1 1 1
