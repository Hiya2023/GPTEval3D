Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (Object 1) has a turquoise color and includes brass elements, but the form is irregular and abstract, similar to melted shapes rather than a conventional desk.
   - The right one (Object 2) accurately depicts a desk with clear turquoise surfaces, proper structure, and definitively shows brass handles, aligning closely with the prompt.

The right one is better because it accurately represents the text description with the deskâ€™s proper form and attributes.

Final answer:
2
