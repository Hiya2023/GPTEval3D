Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model resembles a traditional sofa with visible cushions, while the right model appears less defined and more abstract. The left one better matches the description of "a yellow sofa."
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more like a plausible sofa with consistent proportions and recognizable structure. The right model is less defined with unusual shapes.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns more closely with its geometry, making it a more coherent sofa. The right model's texture and geometry do not align as well.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures more detail with a natural look, while the right one suffers from blurriness and noise.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more organized and detailed geometry compared to the right model's noisier structure.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the above points, the left model provides a better representation of "a yellow sofa" both in form and detail.
   The left one is better.
