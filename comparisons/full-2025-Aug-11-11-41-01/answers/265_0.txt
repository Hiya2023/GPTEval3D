Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The green bicycle is prominent and well-defined. However, no grey dog is visible, leading to incomplete prompt fulfillment.
   - Right (object 2): The grey dog is present and correctly aligned next to a green bicycle. Both elements of the prompt are accurately represented.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
