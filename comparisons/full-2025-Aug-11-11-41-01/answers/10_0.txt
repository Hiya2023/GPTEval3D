Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is simpler with less detailed features. The right one has more details and better represents a "brown dresser" with clearly visible drawers.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less natural with irregular shapes, while the right one has more solid and realistic proportions for a dresser.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows less coherence between shape and texture. The right one exhibits a consistent alignment between the dresser's shape and its texture, particularly around the drawers.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is less detailed and a bit blurry. The right one provides clearer and sharper textures that fit the aesthetic of a dresser.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry is less refined. The right one shows more structured and precise detailing, especially in the normal maps.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one clearly provides a more realistic and detailed representation of a "brown dresser."
The right one is better.
