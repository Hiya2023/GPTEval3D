I'm unable to analyze images directly, but I can guide you on how to approach your analysis. Here's how you could evaluate each criterion based on what you observe:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: Consider if the model accurately represents a "yellow sofa," focusing on its distinct form, color, and features.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Check if this model aligns well with the prompt in terms of color and recognizable sofa-like features.
   - **Decision**: Decide based on which model better captures all elements and the essence of the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Examine for natural structure, solidity, and proportion accuracy.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Look for any inconsistencies or unnatural aspects in form or structure.
   - **Decision**: Choose the model that seems more realistic and solid.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Assess if the textures align well with the shapes, ensuring coherence.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Verify alignment between textures and geometry.
   - **Decision**: Pick the one where textures and geometry match accurately.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Observe local texture clarity and detail sharpness.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Check for any blurriness or lack of detail.
   - **Decision**: Determine which one has more precise and clear texturing.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: Focus on the precision and detail in the normal maps.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Evaluate geometry detail and refinement.
   - **Decision**: Select the model with better-organized and detailed geometry.

6. **Overall**:
   - **Decision**: Make a holistic decision considering all the previous points.

### Final Decision:
Make sure to select the option based on your observations from each criterion, as I can't see the images. Summarize your final decision in the requested format, such as "1 2 2 1 1 2" or similarly, based on your evaluations.
