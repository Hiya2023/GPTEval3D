Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

   - **Left (Object 1)**: The left object appears to be a solid form resembling a cupcake with distinct layers. The colors include blue elements, but no clear red ball or chair structure is visible.

   - **Right (Object 2)**: The right object shows a structure that suggests some form of enclosure or cage. The object includes both blue and red colors, and there is a round red element, which might represent a red ball under some structure possibly suggestive of a chair.

The right one is better as it includes both blue and red elements aligned with the prompt description.

Final answer:
2
