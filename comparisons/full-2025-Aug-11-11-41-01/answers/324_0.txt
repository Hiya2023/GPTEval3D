Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is clearly a lamp with a lampshade and a structured base, resembling the text prompt "A black lamp."
   - The right one does not resemble a lamp; it looks like a completely different object, perhaps a telescope or a similar device.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have a consistent structure, with a recognizable lampshade and stand, although there seems to be some noise or unclear details at the base.
   - The right one, while structured, does not resemble a typical lamp and appears more abstract or unrelated to a lamp design.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has visible texture on the lamp base and shade but appears to be somewhat blurred.
   - The right one has a more detailed texture, especially noticeable on its surface patterns.
   - The right one is better.
