Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: The vase is largely white with scattered golden patterns, but the patterns seem more chaotic and less defined.
   - The right one: The vase is also primarily white with golden patterns that appear more distinct and structured.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Appears less solid with more chaotic and potentially noisy structures.
   - The right one: Seems more solid and plausible, with fewer irregularities or strange structures.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Textures seem noisy and less detailed, particularly in the golden pattern areas.
   - The right one: Textures appear sharper and more realistic, with clearer details in the patterning.
   The right one is better.
