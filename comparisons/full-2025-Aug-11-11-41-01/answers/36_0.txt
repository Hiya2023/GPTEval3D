Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model appears black and resembles a lamp shape more closely; the right model is not aligned with the prompt. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model shows a more solid and realistic shape typical of a lamp, while the right appears distorted. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture of the left model aligns better with the lamp geometry, whereas the right model's texture does not align properly. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture is clearer and more detailed, while the right is blurry and lacks definition. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's geometry is smoother and more defined, while the right shows irregularities and noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model is superior.
