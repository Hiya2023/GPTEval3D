Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clear pink vase and distinct brown shelf; the right has a lot of noise and unclear vase definition. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows more natural proportions and solid shapes; the right one appears distorted and noisy. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one maintains alignment between the vase geometry and texture; the right one has mismatches and noise. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures finer details clearly; the right one is blurred and lacks clarity. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has well-defined geometry; the right one appears messy with unnecessary noise. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model effectively meets all criteria with clarity and alignment.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
