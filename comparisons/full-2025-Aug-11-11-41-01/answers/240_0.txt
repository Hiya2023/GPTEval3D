Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1): Displays a grey dog but lacks a visible green bicycle. The dog's attributes correspond with the prompt, but the absence of the bicycle affects alignment.
   - The right one (object 2): Shows a grey dog and a green bicycle clearly positioned beside it. Both elements accurately reflect the text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
