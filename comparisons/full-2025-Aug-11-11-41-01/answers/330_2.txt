Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one has a vase shape with prominent white color and golden patterns, well aligned with the prompt.
   - The right one also presents a vase with white color and golden adornments but has a grainier texture.
   - The left one is better for clear alignment with the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more structurally sound and plausible as a vase with smoother surfaces.
   - The right one seems less coherent with a rougher appearance and less solid design.
   - The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one's textures are sharper and more detailed in local areas.
   - The right one has grainy textures that lack fine detail and sharpness.
   - The left one is better for low-level texture.
