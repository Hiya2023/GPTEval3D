Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has clearer desk-like features with visible drawers and brass handles, matching the prompt. The right object looks more abstract and less desk-like.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has more realistic proportions and structure, resembling a real desk. The right one appears amorphous and lacks solid desk features.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures align with its structure, with clear handles and drawer details. The right one has mismatched textures and shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object shows clearer details, like the handles and drawers. The right one is overly abstract and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object displays coherent and detailed elements like legs and handles. The right one appears noisy and lacks organized detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object is more aligned with the prompt, plausible, and detailed.
The left one is better.
