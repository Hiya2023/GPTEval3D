Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more balanced representation of pink and grey, though both capture the floral design; the right one seems to overemphasize bright pinks. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural and cushion-like, whereas the right one looks more rigid. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: Both models show good alignment of geometry and texture locally. Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures finer details and looks less abstract, while the right has more vivid but less defined textures. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows smoother and more detailed geometry compared to the noisier right one. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns better with the text prompt and displays superior texture and geometry details. The left one is better.
