Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The vase is pink but with a complex texture and possibly additional colors, not entirely matching the simplicity suggested by the text. The surrounding environment or shelf is not clearly visible.
   - Right (object 2): The vase is clearly pink, with a more straightforward design, better aligning with the prompt. However, the shelf isn't visible.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
