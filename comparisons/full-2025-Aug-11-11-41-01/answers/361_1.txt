Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - **Left (object 1)**: The left object depicts multiple gold fish that appear to be outside the bowl, floating in water.
   - **Right (object 2)**: The right object clearly shows a single fish inside a silver bowl, which better matches the text prompt.
   - **Decision**: Right (object 2) is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (object 1)**: The left object has multiple fish that look less solid and more like they are floating without a clear bowl structure.
   - **Right (object 2)**: The right object has a clear bowl structure with a single fish, appearing more coherent and plausible.
   - **Decision**: Right (object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (object 1)**: The texture is somewhat detailed but lacks sharpness and clear definition, especially as multiple fish images overlap.
   - **Right (object 2)**: The texture of the fish and bowl appears to be more defined and detailed.
   - **Decision**: Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
