Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features a pink vase on a brown shelf as described; the right one has colorful textures but lacks clarity on the shelf. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one maintains solid structure and proportion for the vase and shelf; the right one has an abstract interpretation with less defined shapes.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows consistent alignment between texture and geometry; the right one displays mismatched patterns.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures fine details without blurring; the right one is more abstract and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a smooth and organized structure; the right one exhibits noise and less coherent geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one consistently aligns with the text prompt and exhibits better structure and detail.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
