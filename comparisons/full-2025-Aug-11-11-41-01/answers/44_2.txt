Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is less vibrant and deviates in color; the right one is a vivid blue and captures the chair well.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks less stable and realistic; the right one appears more structurally sound.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has poor texture alignment; the right one has better consistency between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has blurry textures; the right one captures details more sharply.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is less defined; the right has clearer geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one fulfills all criteria more effectively.
The right one is better.
