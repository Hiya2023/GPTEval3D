Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a colorful patterned vase with a unique design and a base, which is not aligned with the black vase prompt.
   - The right one features a plain black vase on a brown background, closely matching the prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has an unusual texture and design for a vase, making it less plausible.
   - The right one appears more normal and solid as a vase.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has complex textures, but they may not align with realism for a vase.
   - The right one has a more realistic texture that suits a black vase.
   The right one is better.
