Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have an unusual structure with three legs and doesn't clearly resemble a typical desk, although the turquoise color and brass elements are present.
   - The right one resembles a desk more closely, with drawers and handles that match the text description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks a coherent form and appears less solid, with strange proportions and structure.
   - The right one is more typical of desk design, with a clear structure and plausible form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a less defined texture, with areas appearing blurry and lacking detail.
   - The right one showcases sharper details, especially in the drawer and handle areas, making the texture more realistic.
   - The right one is better.
