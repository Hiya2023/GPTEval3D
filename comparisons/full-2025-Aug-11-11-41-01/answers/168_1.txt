Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has vibrant colors and unclear blue tones; the right object clearly shows a blue chair.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has irregular shapes; the right object maintains realistic chair proportions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left are chaotic and donâ€™t align well; the right visually matches texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model is chaotic with distracting patterns; the right model maintains consistency and clarity.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left has noisy details that are hard to distinguish; the right is smooth and clear.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object better aligns with the text prompt and has more realistic proportions, textures, and geometry.
The right one is better.
