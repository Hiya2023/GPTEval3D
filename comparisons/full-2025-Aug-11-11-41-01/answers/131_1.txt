Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one includes patterns on the sofa which aren't mentioned in the prompt.
   - The right one is a plain yellow, better aligning with "A yellow sofa."
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a more detailed appearance and realistic proportions.
   - The right one looks more solid but less detailed.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows a mismatch between pattern and geometry.
   - The right one has more consistent texture and geometry alignment.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has more detailed textures but is cluttered.
   - The right one has a flatter texture but not blurry.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows more intricate shapes and detailing.
   - The right one has smoother but less detailed geometry.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the text prompt alignment and plausibility, the right one stands out despite the left one's intricate details.
   The right one is better.
