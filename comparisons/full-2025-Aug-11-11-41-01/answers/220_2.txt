Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The left object is an orange armchair, closely matching the text prompt in both color and form. It appears to have a plush texture and a realistic design.
   - Right (object 2): The right object has a multicolored, patterned texture that does not correspond to "orange". The form is recognizable as an armchair but deviates with the additional colors and patterns.

The left one is better.

Final answer:
