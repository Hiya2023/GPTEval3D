Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one features a yellow cat sitting on a textured white sofa, accurately capturing both the cat's color and the sofa's appearance. It aligns well with the prompt in terms of the positioning and features of the cat and sofa.
   - The right one does not clearly distinguish the cat's color or the sofa, and lacks clarity and detail, making it less aligned with the text prompt.

The left one is better.
