Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) depicts a red car clearly, but the house is not visible. The background is uniformly beige, possibly suggesting the house, but not explicitly.
   - The right one (object 2) shows a red car with a ground-like beige base that could imply the house's color, but no distinct house shape is present.
   
The left one is better, as it shows both elements suggested by the text prompt more clearly with the appropriate colors.

Final answer:
1
