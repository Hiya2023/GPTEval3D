Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a simple turquoise desk but doesn't show brass handles well. The right one aligns better with the text prompt by showing a turquoise desk with brass handles.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has more natural and consistent shapes for a desk. The right one has unrealistic, wavy surfaces.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures align well with geometric shapes. The right one shows misalignment, especially with handle textures.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has some texture details but is a bit plain. The right one has richer textures, though somewhat overdone.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows better-defined geometric details. The right one has noisy and less defined geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects above, the left one achieves better balance in terms of plausibility and alignment.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
