Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clear red car and a beige background; The right one has a red car and green elements, lacking the beige house.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and structured; The right one has overly abstract and unclear proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has better-aligned texture with form; The right one shows discrepancy between shapes and textures.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer details without blurring; The right model's textures lack precision.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more coherent geometry; The right one exhibits inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model more accurately reflects the prompt and exhibits better technical execution.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
