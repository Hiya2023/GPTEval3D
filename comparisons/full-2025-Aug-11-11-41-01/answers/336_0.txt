Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a plant enclosed within a window frame, which aligns well with "a green plant beside a white window."
   - The right one depicts a standalone plant in a pot with a white background, lacking the specific window element.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears as if it's part of a window setting, providing a plausible 3D alignment with the frame and depth.
   - The right one is solid as a standalone plant but misses additional context like the window.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more integrated and realistic texture with visible window framing.
   - The right one, while clear, lacks the detailed context associated with a window.
   - The left one is better.
