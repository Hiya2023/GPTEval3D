Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a colorful floral pattern, which doesn't match the "blue chair" prompt well.
   - The right one is predominantly blue, aligning well with the prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears to have unusual structures and lacks clear solidity, with extraneous elements present.
   - The right model looks more solid and structurally plausible as a chair.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a busy texture due to the floral pattern, but it comes across as noisy.
   - The right one has a cleaner texture with smoother color distribution and apparent detail.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
