Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) shows a red car clearly, but the surrounding doesn't visually suggest a beige house.
   - The right one (object 2) features a red car more distinctively positioned on a ground that could be interpreted as a surrounding area, although it still lacks a clear depiction of a beige house.

The right one is better because it more clearly represents the car with some context in the surrounding.

Final answer:
2
