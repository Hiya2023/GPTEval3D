Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is entirely yellow and fits the prompt; the right one has a blue pattern and deviates from "a yellow sofa."
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and realistic with consistent proportions; the right model has an unusual texture and shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows a good match between color texture and structure; the right oneâ€™s texture doesn't align well with the geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures fine details clearly; the right one is confusing due to the mixed colors and patterns.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one maintains a smooth structure with appropriate detail; the right one is cluttered and lacks clear definition.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model covers the textual and structural requirements more accurately and is more plausible.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
