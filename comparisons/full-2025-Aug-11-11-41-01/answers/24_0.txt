Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object doesn't resemble a lamp and fails to match the text prompt. The right object clearly depicts a lamp with a visible lampshade. 
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears less structured, while the right object has a coherent form resembling a lamp, appearing natural and solid.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The right object's geometry and texture align well, showing a clear lamp shape in both RGB and normal images. The left one lacks recognizable structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right object captures detailed features like the lampshade and base in its texture. The left one appears vague and less detailed.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The right object's normal maps exhibit a well-defined lamp shape with detailed intricacies, while the left object's geometry is less discernible.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object consistently meets all criteria better than the left.
   The right one is better.
