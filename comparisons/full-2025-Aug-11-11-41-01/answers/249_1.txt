Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- **Left (Object 1)**: Clearly displays a chair with a blue upholstery and detailed armrests. The texture and form of a chair are well-defined. The normal renderings show detailed surface structure, reflecting more complexity and a clear correspondence to the "chair" aspect of the prompt.

- **Right (Object 2)**: Also depicts a blue chair, but lacks armrests and appears less detailed. The overall form matches a chair, but itâ€™s more simplified compared to the left object. The normal renderings reveal less surface detail, suggesting a simpler asset alignment.

The left one is better.

Final answer:
