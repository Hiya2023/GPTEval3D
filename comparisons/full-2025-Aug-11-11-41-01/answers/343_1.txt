Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears closer to a typical table shape with a round top and supporting legs. 
   - The right object looks less like a traditional table, with an irregular structure.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears more stable and plausible as a table. It has a flat surface and leg-like structures beneath.
   - The right object seems less stable due to its irregular shape.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object's texture is mostly smooth and lacks detail, but it's understandable given the "white table" prompt.
   - The right object's texture has more variation and depth, appearing more detailed.
   - The right one is better.
