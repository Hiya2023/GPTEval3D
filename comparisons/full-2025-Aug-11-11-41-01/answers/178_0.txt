Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one lacks clear detail and structure relevant to the description.
   - The right one resembles a sofa more closely with visible brown and some stripes.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears distorted with unclear features.
   - The right one appears more natural, resembling a sofa in proportion and shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows poor alignment between geometry and texture.
   - The right one has better alignment, with the texture mapping more closely to the shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one is blurry and lacks defined texture.
   - The right one captures more defined textures with visible stripes.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has unclear and noisy geometry.
   - The right one has more coherent and distinct geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one consistently outperforms the left in all criteria.
   - The right one is better.
