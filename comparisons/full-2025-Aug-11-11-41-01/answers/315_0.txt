Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a brown table, lacking the black vase element.
   - The right model looks like a black vase on a neutral background.
   - The right one aligns better with the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid but is incomplete in fulfilling the prompt as it lacks the vase.
   - The right model appears more plausible as a vase despite some potential noise.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a more detailed and realistic wood texture.
   - The right modelâ€™s texture is less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
