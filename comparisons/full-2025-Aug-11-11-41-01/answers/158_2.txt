Analysis:
1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features blue and gold patterns, which diverge from the "white vase with golden patterns" description. The right model more accurately reflects a white base with golden patterns.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model seems overly stylized and less natural. The right model appears more solid and plausible with the correct vase shape and proportions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model displays a mismatch between texture and geometry with inaccurate structure. The right model shows a better alignment of texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has blurry and incorrect textures for the prompt. The right model successfully captures fine texture details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has noisy geometry unlikely to represent a smooth vase. The right model exhibits a more clean and detailed structure.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all criteria, the right model performs better in alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometry.
The right one is better.
