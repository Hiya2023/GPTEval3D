Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: Represents a blue chair, potentially aligns well with the prompt.
   - The right one: Also shows a blue chair with possibly more desk-like elements visible.
   - The right one is better as it captures more elements of the prompt "facing a black desk."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Appears solid and normal with distinct features.
   - The right one: Also appears solid but the structure looks slightly less distinct.
   - The left one is better due to clearer structure and solid appearance.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Texture is clear with distinct colors.
   - The right one: Texture is slightly blurry but has realistic variations.
   - The left one is better due to sharper and clearer textures.

Final answer:
