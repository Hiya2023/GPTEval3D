Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one includes a red car with no clear house visible.
   - The right one shows a red car and parts of a house are visible.
   - The right one is better for covering the text prompt "A red car beside a beige house".

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears as a more solid and complete 3D model of a car.
   - The right one has fragmented and less cohesive structures.
   - The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a consistent texture but less detail and sharpness.
   - The right one shows more detailed and realistic textures.
   - The right one is better in terms of texture.
