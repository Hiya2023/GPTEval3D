Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one resembles a table with a turquoise top and brass accents. However, it lacks detailed features that a desk typically has, such as drawers or handles.
   - The right one clearly features a desk with multiple drawers and visible brass handles aligning with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems less stable with an unusual leg structure, potentially lacking realism in a functional desk.
   - The right one appears more structured and solid, consistent with typical desk architecture.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has somewhat blurry and less defined textures, with a lack of detailed features.
   - The right one has more detailed textures, with clearer patterns and visible handle details.
   - The right one is better.
