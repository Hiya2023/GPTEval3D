Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model is vaguely shaped and doesn't accurately convey the recognizable form of a sofa. The right model clearly represents a sofa with cushions and appropriate structure.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model lacks clear structure and appears amorphous, while the right model has well-defined features like armrests and cushions, giving it a more solid and plausible appearance.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture seems misaligned with the form, while the right model's texture and geometry are more cohesive, showing better alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model exhibits noisy, undefined texture, while the right model demonstrates more clear and coherent texture details that fit a sofa model.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model lacks significant geometric detail and appears rough. The right model shows more intricate and smoother geometry typical of a sofa structure.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects of evaluation, the right model exhibits better alignment with the prompt, plausibility, and detailed representation.
The right one is better.
