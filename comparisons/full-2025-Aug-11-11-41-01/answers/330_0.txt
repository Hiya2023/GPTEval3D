Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to follow the description more closely, showcasing a white vase with distinguishable golden patterns spread evenly around it.
   - The right object also has golden patterns, but they appear less distinct and not as well-defined on the white vase.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object looks consistent and maintains a solid form across different views, with no obvious duplications or structural noise.
   - The right object appears less cohesive, with some patterns looking oddly placed or distorted.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object exhibits sharper textures with more detail in the golden patterns.
   - The right object's textures appear fuzzier and lack the same level of sharpness.
   - The left one is better.
