Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one includes a plant in a pot without a window; the right one shows a plant without a clear window. Neither fully aligns with "A green plant beside a white window."
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural with solid modeling; the right one has disjointed elements.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has consistent alignment between texture and shape; the right one shows mismatches.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clear textures; the right one appears colorful but less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother, organized structures; the right one is disorganized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one aligns better with texture, geometry, and natural appeal.
The left one is better.
