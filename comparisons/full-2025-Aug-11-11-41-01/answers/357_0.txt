Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to have a simple tabletop with straightforward legs, aligning well with "a white table."
   - The right model has a more ornate design and includes additional elements not typical of a simple "white table."
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks normal and solid, with typical table features.
   - The right model seems less typical for a table, with complex features that could suggest instability or strangeness in a standard table context.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a simple texture, which is consistent but not very detailed.
   - The right model shows more texture details, with distinct patterns and colors, enhancing realism.
   - The right one is better.
