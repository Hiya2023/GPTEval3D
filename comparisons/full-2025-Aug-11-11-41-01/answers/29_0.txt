Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model accurately reflects the description of a "blue chair" with solid tonal consistency; the right model shows inconsistent colors. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural, with proper proportions and fewer irregularities; the right model displays disproportionate features.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better alignment between geometry and texture; the right model has texture misalignment in places.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model exhibits clearer textures with sharper details; the right model appears to have blurred features.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has well-defined geometry without noise; the right model shows noisy geometry in the normal maps.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model consistently excels in alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometry.
   The left one is better.
