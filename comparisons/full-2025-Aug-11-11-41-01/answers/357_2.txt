Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one (Object 1) appears to have a basic, simple table shape with a white color, matching the text prompt "A white table."
   - The right one (Object 2) has a more ornate design with additional colors and details that arenâ€™t mentioned in the text prompt.

   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a standard table but seems to lack structural detailing such as legs.
   - The right one has a more detailed base, indicating a more realistic and solid design despite additional colors.

   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smooth, uniform texture with less detail.
   - The right one shows detailed textures and additional colors, providing a more intricate appearance.

   The right one is better.
