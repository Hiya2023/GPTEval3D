Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object is a traditional lamp with a green lampshade and ornate base.
   - The right object appears to be a cylindrical, textured object that does not resemble a lamp.
   - The left one is better as it closely matches the description "A black lamp" (though the shade is green).

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears coherent and consistent with lamp structure.
   - The right object looks more abstract and doesn't effectively translate into a plausible lamp structure.
   - The left one is better due to its normal, solid structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has visible textures on the base, though the shade is simple.
   - The right object has detailed textures but lacks relevance to the prompt.
   - The right one is better in terms of detailed texture quality.
