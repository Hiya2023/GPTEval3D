Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one displays a brown sofa but lacks clear black stripes.
   - The right one has a sofa with visible black stripes but additional elements not specified.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks more solid and coherent as a sofa.
   - The right one has inconsistencies in structure due to added patterns and objects.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one has consistent alignment between geometry and texture.
   - The right one shows misalignment due to added designs.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one has subtle but smooth details.
   - The right one appears too complex and deviates from the prompt.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one exhibits smoother geometry.
   - The right has unnecessary clutter.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the aspects mentioned above, the left one adheres more to the prompt and is structurally sound.
   The left one is better.
