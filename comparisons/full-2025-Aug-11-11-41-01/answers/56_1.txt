Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears to be a clear yellow sofa, corresponding well with the prompt. The right one is more ambiguous in color and form. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more like a recognizable sofa with plausible proportions. The right one has an unclear structure. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left oneâ€™s texture aligns with the sofa shape, while the right one has mismatched textures. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays clearer texture details, while the right one is more noisy. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows smoother and more organized geometry, while the right one appears chaotic. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one is more aligned with the prompt and exhibits better quality in most criteria. The left one is better.

Final answer:
