Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more complete structure with four legs, corresponding to a table. The right one appears to have only one central support, which does not align well with the description of a table. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one resembles a standard table with four legs, whereas the right one looks unstable with a single central leg, making it less plausible. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object displays a more consistent alignment between texture and shape, while the right one has inconsistencies, especially with the single leg structure. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object maintains clearer and more detailed textures across various views, while the right one lacks detail and coherence. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has superior geometric details with well-defined legs and tabletop, while the right one is less structured. The left one is better.

6. Overall: Taking into account all aspects, the left model consistently outperforms the right one.

The left one is better.
