Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is mostly brown and doesn't accurately reflect the prompt of a "yellow sofa." The right one is clearly yellow and resembles a sofa better. 
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has an irregular shape and doesn't look solid. The right one has a more coherent structure and plausible sofa shape.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has textures that don't align well with the sofa shape. The right one shows a clearer alignment between the sofa shape and texture.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is blurry and lacks detail. The right one has more defined textures that enhance the sofa appearance.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has disorganized geometry and lacks detail. The right one has a more organized structure with intricate details.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right one better fulfills the requirements and aligns with the prompt description.
   The right one is better.
