Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one uses a multicolored texture, deviating from the "orange armchair" description, whereas the right one is consistently orange. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has awkward proportions and textures that make it less plausible; the right one looks more realistic and plausible in shape. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has misaligned textures that don't match the geometry well; the right one maintains a consistent texture that aligns better with its geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears noisy and cluttered; the right one has clearer texture details that suit the prompt. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits noise and irregularities; the right one has smoother and more organized geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right model performs better across the board. The right one is better.
