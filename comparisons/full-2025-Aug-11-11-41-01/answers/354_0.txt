Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is a uniformly brown sofa.
   - The right model is a sofa with a mix of brown and black stripes, aligning well with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and consistent as a 3D object.
   - The right model has stripes but might appear less solid due to textures and shapes.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a more uniform texture with less detail.
   - The right model exhibits more detailed textures, especially with stripes and cushions.
   - The right one is better.
