Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a vibrant, multi-color appearance not matching the orange prompt; the right one accurately reflects an orange armchair.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears irregular and overly vibrant; the right one appears more solid and realistic.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has mismatched textures; the right one's texture aligns better with its shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has noisy textures; the right one has consistent texture detailing for an armchair.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has irregular geometric noise; the right one has smooth and appropriate structural details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model aligns well with the prompt and demonstrates higher plausibility and detail alignment.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
