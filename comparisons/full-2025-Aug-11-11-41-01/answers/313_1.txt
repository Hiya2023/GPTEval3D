Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Depicts a fish with some gold coloring, but there is no visible bowl.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Shows a complete fish inside a silver bowl, closely matching the text prompt.
   
   **The right one is better.**

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The fish looks somewhat flat with no surrounding structure to suggest a bowl, which affects its plausibility.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The fish and the bowl seem well-structured, forming a believable 3D model.
   
   **The right one is better.**

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The textures are a bit blurred and lack detail.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The textures are more detailed and sharper, especially in the fish's features and the bowl.
   
   **The right one is better.**

Final answer:
