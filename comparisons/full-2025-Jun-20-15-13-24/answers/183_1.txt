Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left vase has a more traditional Chinese style and delicate floral patterns, more closely aligning with the "vintage Chinese vase" description. The right vase is less traditional and uses bolder colors and patterns. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left vase appears more balanced and harmonious in its shape and design, while the right vase has irregular proportions and appears less natural. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left vase's texture and geometry match well, with the floral patterns aligning with the overall shape. The right vase shows mismatched alignment. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left vase captures fine details with clarity and subtlety, whereas the right vase appears overly saturated and less detailed. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left vase has smooth, detailed geometry, while the right vase shows more noise and less consistent shape. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left vase better captures the text prompt and exhibits superior texture, geometry, and plausibility.
The left one is better.
