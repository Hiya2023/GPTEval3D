Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model captures a classic African mask with subtle modern influences in its design, using traditional colors and shapes. The right model, however, strongly emphasizes abstract art with vivid colors and patterns, aligning better with the "modern abstract art influences" part of the prompt. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model's structure appears more natural and solid with well-defined features of a traditional mask. The right model has a slightly exaggerated form that may affect its plausibility as a realistic object.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures and geometry of the left model are cohesively fused, reflecting realistic mask features. The right model's textures do align well, but the abstract patterns sometimes deviate from the actual geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model displays more refined and clear texture details, maintaining clarity and realistic appearance. The right model, while vibrant, has some areas where the texture seems slightly less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows smoother and more precise geometry in the normal map, closely resembling a genuine mask structure. The right modelâ€™s exaggerated abstract elements introduce some disordered details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model successfully captures the essence of a classic mask while integrating some modern elements without losing structure and detail.
The left one is better.
