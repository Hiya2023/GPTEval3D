Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a simple gown with floral designs, but lacks the Japanese vase.
   - The right one includes a more detailed gown and a visible vase, matching the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left gown's proportions are standard, but there's a lack of complexity.
   - The right one appears more natural and detailed, with the gown having realistic elements.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object shows less detail in texture-geometric correspondence.
   - The right object has better alignment with textures matching the shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has relatively smooth textures.
   - The right one shows complex details and rich textures on both gown and vase.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has simple geometry without much detail.
   - The right one has intricate geometry, evident in the folds and accompanying elements.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model fulfills all criteria more effectively, with better alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometry.
   - The right one is better.
