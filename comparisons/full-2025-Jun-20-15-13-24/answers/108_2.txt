Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a lamp on a surface, not aligned to the description of a teapot and table. The right one also shows a lamp. Neither aligns with the prompt.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one has a more cohesive structure for a lamp; the right one is similar but slightly less defined.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one's texture matches its geometry without significant mismatch. The right one is similar but slightly less precise.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one captures more detailed textures on the lamp base. The right one is less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one shows more refined details in the lamp stem and base. The right one lacks these details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one has better texture detail and alignment, despite not matching the prompt.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
