I'm unable to directly see or analyze the images you uploaded. Therefore, I'll guide you through the process of evaluating the images based on the criteria you've provided:

**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
   - **Left:** Check if there is a rustic Italian teapot and a Scandinavian wooden table.
   - **Right:** Check for the same items.
   - Decide which model aligns more closely with the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left:** Assess the realism, proportions, and solid appearance of the 3D structure of the objects.
   - **Right:** Do the same assessment.
   - Determine which model looks more natural and plausible.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - **Left:** Evaluate how well the texture fits the shape of the objects.
   - **Right:** Do the same evaluation.
   - Decide which has better alignment of texture and geometry.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - **Left:** Look for clarity and detail in the textures.
   - **Right:** Assess the textures similarly.
   - Determine which model captures more fine details.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - **Left:** Examine the normal maps for accurate and organized geometry.
   - **Right:** Do the same examination.
   - Decide which has more detailed and efficient geometry.

6. **Overall:**
   - Combine your insights from the above criteria to determine which model is better overall.

Based on your evaluations, fill in the final decision section using the options provided: "Left (object 1) is better", "Right (object 2) is better", or "Cannot decide". 

Since I cannot see the images, please carry out this evaluation carefully by examining each aspect as outlined.
