Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one matches the classic African mask with abstract details. The right one lacks clarity in abstract features. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a solid structure and plausible face proportions. The right one appears flat and less natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better texture adherence to its 3D shape, with visible contours. The right one shows less alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures detailed textures without blurring. The right one appears more muted and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits intricate geometric details, while the right one has a smoother, less detailed surface.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one better represents the prompt, is more plausible, and displays superior texture and geometric detail.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
