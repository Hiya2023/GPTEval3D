Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one lacks the presence of a Japanese vase; the right one also only showcases a dress without a vase.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model shows smoother transitions and a more defined structure; the right one appears less solid and slightly distorted.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has textures that align more closely with the gown structure; the right one shows some misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures floral patterns in finer detail without blurring; the right one appears less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model appears smoother and more visually organized; the right one has less defined geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more cohesive and natural.
The left one is better.
