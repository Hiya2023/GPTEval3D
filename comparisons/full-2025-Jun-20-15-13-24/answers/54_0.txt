Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model shows a dress but lacks teapot representation. The right model represents both a vibrant dress and a teapot, aligning better with the prompt.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more natural with solid proportions. The right model's dress has less realistic proportions and more noise.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has more consistent texture alignment with its shape. The right model's texture does not align as well with the geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model maintains more detail without blurriness. The right model appears overly stylized and abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has a smoother and more organized geometry. The right model shows more noise and less clarity.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria, the left model shows better quality in most aspects, although it lacks full object representation.
The left one is better.
