2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has distorted proportions; the right one appears more natural and proportionate.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures do not align well with the geometry; the right one shows better alignment between shape and texture.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has noisy and abstract textures; the right one has clearer, more realistic textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits chaotic geometry; the right one appears more structured and accurate.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one presents a more cohesive and accurate representation of a modern Scandinavian chair.
The right one is better.
