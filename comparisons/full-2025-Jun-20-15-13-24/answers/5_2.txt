Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object showcases a dress with a multicolored pattern but lacks a teapot.
   - The right object is a single-color dress without a teapot.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model has a more complex pattern that may look less plausible.
   - The right model has a simple and consistent shape.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left model combines intricate textures with geometry but may not align perfectly.
   - The right model shows a good match between texture and shape.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model has vibrant, intricate textures.
   - The right model has simpler, clearer textures.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model has more detailed geometry but may appear noisy.
   - The right model has smooth geometry with fewer details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria above, the decision leans towards the left due to better textural detail and alignment with the prompt.

Final answer:
1 2 2 1 1 1
