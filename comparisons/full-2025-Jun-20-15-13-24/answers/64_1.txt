The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one maintains a consistent and plausible vase structure, with proportions typical of a vase. The right one has noticeable irregularities in its form.  
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture is well-integrated with its geometry, presenting a uniform look. The right one shows some misalignment, with textures not matching the geometric patterns.  
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has finer, more appropriate texture details that suit the minimalist aesthetic. The right one appears overly embellished.  
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has well-organized geometry without extraneous noise, while the right one displays unnecessary complexity and noise.  
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one better fulfills the criteria across the board.
