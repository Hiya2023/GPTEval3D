Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model captures the details of a contemporary teapot placed on a Persian-style table, as seen in its intricate patterns. The right model appears to have a more generic design without clear attributes tying back to the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model shows more realistic proportions and details, resembling an actual teapot. The right model lacks certain realistic features and details that make it plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better alignment between the texture and the geometry, with patterns reflected accurately in both RGB and normals. The right model has mismatches in texture application.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has finer and clearer details, capturing the texture intricacy well. The right one appears more simplistic and less defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model demonstrates more detailed and structured geometry in the normal maps, reflecting the object's shape accurately. The right model has less geometric detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model accurately reflects the prompt, maintains realism, and has better texture and geometry alignment.
The left one is better.
