The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears solid and well-formed, but its design is more intricate than minimalist. The right model has a simpler design, fitting the minimalist description better.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model’s texture doesn’t align as cohesively with the minimalist form. The right model’s texture and geometry are well-aligned, maintaining the consistent floral pattern.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is more vivid but not subtle or minimalist. The right model captures floral details appropriately with less saturation, fitting the aesthetic better.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has more intricate geometry, but it's not minimalist. The right model maintains smooth surfaces with proper detailing where needed.
The right one is better.
