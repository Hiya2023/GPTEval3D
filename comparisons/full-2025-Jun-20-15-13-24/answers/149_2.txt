Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures the teapot shape, but the right one includes both the teapot and a table, aligning more closely with "a contemporary Chinese teapot on a traditional Persian table."
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and complete. The right model shows some irregularities and texture mismatches.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has consistent texture with the geometry, while the right model has misaligned textures.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clearer textures. The right modelâ€™s textures appear noisy and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows well-defined geometry. The right model has some inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment with the text prompt and overall execution, the right one captures the scene more accurately, but the left one has better technical quality.
The left one is better.
