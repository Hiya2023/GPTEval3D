Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a clear depiction of a teapot but lacks detail on the Persian table. The right model better integrates both the teapot and the table, showing more alignment with the text prompt.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left teapot looks more natural in terms of shape and structure. The right one seems distorted and less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has a reasonable alignment between texture and geometry. The right model shows discrepancies between textures and shapes.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more defined textures, while the right appears blurry.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits smoother and well-organized geometry. The right one looks noisy and less detailed.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left one shows better geometry, texture alignment, and detail, though the right has better alignment with the text prompt.
The left one is better.
