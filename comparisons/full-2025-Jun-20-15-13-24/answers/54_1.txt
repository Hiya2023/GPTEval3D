Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object captures a single dress without any other objects, not fully covering the prompt. The right object includes the dress with vibrant patterns but lacks the teapot. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object seems more solid and realistic, while the right one appears distorted and less natural. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture follows the dress smoothly, while the right object's texture appears misaligned with geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object displays finer texture details and color gradients, while the right one looks patchy. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has smoother and consistent geometry, while the right one has irregularities. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left object aligns better with the mentioned aspects except for missing the teapot. The left one is better.
