1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model accurately depicts a mask, aligning with the prompt "A colorful African mask." The right model includes additional elements, like foliage, and doesn't match the mask description precisely. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model maintains a realistic and consistent shape of a mask. The right model has irregularities and seems chaotic. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left model match the geometry of a mask, enhancing realism. The right model shows mismatched textures and geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details with clarity that aligns with the mask theme. The right model's textures are noisy and less defined. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model represents the detailed geometry of a mask smoothly and pleasingly. The right model is disorganized and lacks clear structure. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model excels in all aspects by accurately depicting a colorful African mask. The left one is better.
