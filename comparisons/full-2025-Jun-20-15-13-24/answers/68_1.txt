Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features a detailed, ornate design suitable for "a contemporary Chinese teapot on a traditional Persian table," while the right model appears plain and lacks cultural distinctiveness. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more refined with correct proportions, while the right model seems blocky and less detailed in its structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better alignment between the RGB and normal maps, reflecting appropriate cultural designs, whereas the right lacks this detail.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model displays intricate designs and vivid textures, consistent with the prompt, while the right lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has well-defined and aesthetically pleasing geometric details. The right model is simpler and less detailed.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns well with the prompt, is more plausible, and has better texture and geometry.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
