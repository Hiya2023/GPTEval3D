2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has overly vibrant and unreal textures, with some distortion.
   - The right model appears natural with more appropriate texture and flow.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has mismatched textures and geometry; textures look more abstract.
   - The right one has consistent and appropriately placed textures that match the geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has overly bright textures that appear abstract and not suitable for an evening gown.
