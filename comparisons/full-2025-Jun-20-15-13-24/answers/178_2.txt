Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a vivid blue and gold pattern that partially aligns with "vintage French" styles but may not capture the intricate detailing as accurately as desired. The right one has a more intricate floral design typical of vintage French teapots. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left teapot has a more uniform and coherent shape. The right one, while detailed, shows some irregularities that detract from its solidity. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left teapot's textures align well with its geometry, with patterns following the shape effectively. The right one shows some misalignment between texture and form. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left teapot appears slightly more abstract, while the right one captures finer details with its floral designs. 
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The right teapot's geometry has more intricate detailing, capturing the nuances better, while the left one is simpler in shape.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the alignment with the text prompt and finer details, the right one has more qualities of a vintage French teapot, despite some plausibility issues.
The right one is better.
