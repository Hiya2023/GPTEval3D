3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows consistent alignment between texture and geometry, while the right has more divergence between surface detail and texture. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are detailed and not blurry, matching the rustic aesthetic. The right model's textures appear more stylized. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model displays smoother, more realistic details, while the right has more noise. The left one is better.
