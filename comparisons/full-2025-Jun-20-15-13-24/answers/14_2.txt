Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left teapot has intricate designs but seems more abstract; the right teapot has defined designs and ornamentation. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left teapot appears more solid and natural; the right one has unusual proportions and elements. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left teapot's texture aligns well with its shapes; the right teapot shows some misalignment between details and shapes. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left teapot has fine texture details; the right teapot's details appear more stylized but less detailed. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left teapot has more intricate and smooth geometry; the right one is less detailed. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left teapot aligns well with physical plausibility and fine details. The left one is better.
