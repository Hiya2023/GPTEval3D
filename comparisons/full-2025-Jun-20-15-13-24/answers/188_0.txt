Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures the gown more elegantly, but lacks the vase. The right one attempts the gown and has a vase but less ornamentation.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model seems more solid and natural with better proportions. The right one appears slightly distorted.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left oneâ€™s texture matches its smooth geometry, while the right one has mismatched checkered texture.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has smooth and consistent textures, while the right one has distracting patterns.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has well-defined shapes without noise. The right one has more geometric noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the right model includes both objects mentioned in the prompt but lacks quality in several areas.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
2 1 1 1 1 1
