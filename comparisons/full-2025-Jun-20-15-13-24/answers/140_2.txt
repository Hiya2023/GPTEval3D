Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left teapot exhibits a vintage style but the designs are less clear.
   - The right teapot has more visible designs that match the "intricate" aspect.
   - Right is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left teapot appears more solid and plausible with correct proportions.
   - The right teapot has some irregularities and looks less natural.
   - Left is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left shows better alignment between texture and geometry.
   - The right one has some mismatches in texture and shape.
   - Left is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left teapot appears slightly more detailed but still somewhat blurred.
   - The right teapot shows stronger texture details even if not perfectly aligned.
   - Cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left teapot has smoother and more coherent geometry.
   - The right teapot has visible noise affecting the detail consistency.
   - Left is better.

6. Overall: 
   - Considering prompt alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometry alignment, the left one overall represents the prompt better.
   - Left is better.

Final answer:
