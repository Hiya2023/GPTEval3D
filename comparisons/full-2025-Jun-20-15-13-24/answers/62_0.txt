   - The right one seems less defined and more abstract.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one exhibits a coherent integration of floral textures with the gown's shape.
   - The right one shows less alignment between texture and gown shape.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has intricate details and a clear floral pattern.
   - The right oneâ€™s textures appear less detailed and more abstract.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
