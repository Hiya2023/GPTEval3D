The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows a consistent form with good proportions, while the right one also maintains a believable structure but looks slightly less natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures align well with its geometry, giving it an authentic look. The right one also aligns, but the texture appears less worn.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows intricate details in its rustic texture. The right one is less detailed and appears too uniform.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has more detailed geometry with a natural appearance. The right one shows less detailed, simpler geometry.
The left one is better.
