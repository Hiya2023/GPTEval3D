Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a more traditional appearance with a floral pattern fitting well with the "vintage" and "Chinese vase" description. The right object, while colorful, has a less convincing vintage look. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object's proportions and shape are consistent and realistic for a vase. The right object appears less stable with a somewhat inflated form.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left object aligns well with its shape, maintaining the floral details. The right object shows misalignment in texture patterns.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures fine floral details clearly without blur. The right object appears too abstract with less defined details.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has smooth and well-organized geometry in its normal map that corresponds well to its shape. The right object exhibits inconsistencies and noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left object consistently aligns better with the criteria.
The left one is better.
