Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a more rustic appearance but lacks intricate design details.
   - The right object features detailed floral patterns, aligning better with "intricate designs."  
   The right one is better.
   
2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has some disproportionate elements and appears less solid.
   - The right object looks more cohesive and realistic as a teapot.  
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture doesn't clearly match its geometry.
   - The right object shows a better alignment between texture and geometry.  
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object lacks fine details and appears somewhat blurry.
   - The right object has sharp, detailed textures.  
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows less detailed geometry and some noise.
   - The right object has finer geometry details, though some distortion is present.  
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right object consistently aligns better across all criteria.  
   The right one is better.
