Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left: The object does not resemble a "modern Scandinavian chair" and seems abstract.
   - Right: The object clearly depicts a chair that fits the description.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: Appears unnatural and lacks real-world object resemblance.
   - Right: Looks solid and plausible as a chair.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - Left: The shape doesn't align well with any chair-like form or texture.
   - Right: The texture adheres well to the chair geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - Left: Texture is abstract and unclear.
   - Right: Shows fine details and realistic textures for a chair.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - Left: Geometry is abstract and lacks detail.
   - Right: Geometry is well-represented and smooth.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right model excels in all aspects related to the prompt, 3D plausibility, texture alignment, and detail.
   The right one is better.
