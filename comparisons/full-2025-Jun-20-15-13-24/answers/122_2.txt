Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears chaotic with unclear structures that do not resemble a mask, while the right one clearly depicts a face-like structure with vibrant colors fitting the description of a "colorful African mask." The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object's structures are irregular and lack coherence. The right object has consistent, structured form and solid appearance. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows a mismatch between geometry and texture, appearing disorganized. The right object has textures that align well with the mask shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object is busy and lacks clarity, whereas the right object maintains finer texture details that enhance the mask's appearance. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has confusing and noisy details, while the right displays a clearly defined mask shape with detailed features. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering the above criteria, the right one is better.
