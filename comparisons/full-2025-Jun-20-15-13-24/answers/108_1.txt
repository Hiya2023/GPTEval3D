I'm unable to view or evaluate images directly. However, I can guide you on how to assess the images based on your criteria. Here's how you can proceed:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment:**
   - Describe each model in terms of how well they align with the text prompt "A rustic Italian teapot set on a sleek Scandinavian wooden table."
   - Consider if the objects presented resemble a teapot and a table, and if they match the style descriptors (rustic Italian, sleek Scandinavian).
   - Decide which one aligns better based on these observations.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - Evaluate the naturalness and solidity of each model.
   - Check for proper proportions and lack of irregularities.
   - Decide which one appears more realistic and plausible.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - Review how well the textures overlay with the geometry of each model.
   - Ensure the textures match the shapes in both the RGB and normal maps.
   - Decide which model exhibits better alignment.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - Assess the fine details in the textures.
   - Look for clarity and aesthetic appeal, avoiding unnecessary abstraction unless specified.
   - Decide which model captures textures more effectively.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - Focus on the intricacy and organization of the geometry.
   - Evaluate smoothness and pleasing structure.
   - Decide which model demonstrates better geometric detail.

6. **Overall:**
   - Combine insights from all criteria.
   - Determine which model performs better across all aspects.

### Final Decision:

After evaluating and making a decision for each criterion individually, consolidate your findings using the specified format:

- 1 (Left is better), 2 (Right is better), 3 (Cannot decide).

For example:
```
1 2 2 1 1 2
```
