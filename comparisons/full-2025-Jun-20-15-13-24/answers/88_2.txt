Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object depicts a gown but the vase is missing; the right object is missing the vase as well. Neither fully matches the text prompt.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more solid and natural-looking gown shape; the right object appears less stable and natural.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows a better match between texture and geometry; the right has mismatched floral textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clear outlines and details; the right one appears more abstract and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left objectâ€™s geometry is smoother and more organized; the right one appears noisy and less structurally defined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria except prompt alignment, the left object is superior in terms of plausibility, texture, and geometry detail.
The left one is better.
