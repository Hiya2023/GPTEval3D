Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model includes both a teapot and a table, while the right model focuses mainly on the teapot. The left is better for capturing the full scene.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model shows an irregular shape, whereas the right model maintains a more natural and plausible teapot form.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures seem misaligned with protrusions, whereas the right has more consistent texture and geometry alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model is blurry, lacking detail; the right model captures finer details, especially on the teapot surface.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model appears unstructured; the right model shows better organization and detailed geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model better captures the intended teapot design with appropriate geometry and texture alignment.
The right one is better.
