   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has decent alignment between geometry and texture; the right one's patterns match the shape more seamlessly.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has basic details with some blurring; the right one shows intricate designs and clearer details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother but less detailed geometry; the right one shows more refined structural details.
