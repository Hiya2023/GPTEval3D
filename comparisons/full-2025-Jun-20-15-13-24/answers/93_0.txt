Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one features a gown with a distinct pattern but lacks the ornate Japanese vase; the right one shows a gown but similarly lacks a vase. The left one adheres better to the elegance aspect of the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more natural shape and flow of fabric, while the right one appears somewhat stiff and less realistic.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with the geometry, giving the gown depth; the right one also aligns well, but the left side's pattern provides better local detail alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has a vibrant, detailed pattern, capturing fine detail effectively, while the right one is more subdued and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one showcases intricate folds and structure in the normal map, while the right one appears smooth with less detailed geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all factors, the left one provides better alignment, detail, and plausibility.
The left one is better.
