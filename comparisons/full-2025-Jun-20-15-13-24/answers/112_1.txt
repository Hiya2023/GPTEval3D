Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one clearly depicts an African mask with vivid colors as described; The right one is abstract and deviates from the mask concept.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears as a solid, natural mask; The right one is chaotic and lacks a coherent structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with the mask's shape; The right one shows misalignment and irregularities.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clear, defined textures appropriate for a mask; The right one is confusing and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one presents well-organized and smooth geometry; The right one is noisy and disorganized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model is consistently better in all evaluations.
The left one is better.


Final answer:
