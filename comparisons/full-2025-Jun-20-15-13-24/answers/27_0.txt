Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left vase effectively depicts a minimalist style with more subtle engravings, matching the Japanese aesthetics described. The right vase is more decorated and less minimalist. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: Both vases appear solid and plausible, with no major irregularities. The proportions and shapes are consistent. 
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left vase has a texture that aligns well with its shape, displaying coherence between the RGB and normal maps. The right vase's texture does not align as smoothly.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left vase captures details effectively, while the right vase looks more detailed yet less minimalist, contrary to the prompt. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left vase maintains clean and efficient geometry in the normal map. The right vase displays more complexity but lacks coherence.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left vase aligns better with the prompt's minimalist requirement while maintaining plausible geometry and textures.
The left one is better.
