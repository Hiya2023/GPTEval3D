Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model is simplistic and dark, lacking detail; the right model depicts a teapot with visible details and a table, aligning better with the description.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears flat and lacks depth; the right model shows a more solid and plausible structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model lacks clear details that align with the shape; the right model shows coherent alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model is very basic and lacks texture; the right model includes more details and texture that reflect a teapot on a table.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model is not detailed; the right model exhibits more intricate shapes and details in the geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model covers more aspects of the criteria successfully.
The right one is better.
