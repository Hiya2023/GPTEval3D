   - The right model accurately includes both the gown and an ornate vase, as well as floral details.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears less natural due to its flat colors and lack of additional elements.
   - The right model exhibits more realistic features with detailed floral and vase structures.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model’s texture doesn’t align well with its geometry, appearing more abstract.
   - The right model shows better alignment between texture and shape, especially with the floral elements.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model lacks fine texture details and appears somewhat flat.
   - The right model captures intricate details in the gown and vase.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model’s geometry is simple, while the texture is not detailed.
   - The right model has more visually pleasing and detailed geometry, especially around floral elements.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right model more accurately represents the text prompt with elegant and detailed designs.
