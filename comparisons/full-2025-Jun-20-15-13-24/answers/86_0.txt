Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears to have a simpler form without clear alignment to the text prompt. The right object exhibits more details that might correspond to a teapot on a table. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object looks more abstract and lacks distinct features, whereas the right object shows defined shapes that align more with a plausible 3D scene of a teapot set on a table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows less texture integration with its abstract shape, while the right object demonstrates a better alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has simpler textures, lacking in fine detail. The right object offers more intricate and clear-textured details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is quite basic, whereas the right object provides more complex and correctly proportioned geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object better fulfills the criteria of text prompt alignment, 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, and detail richness.
The right one is better.
