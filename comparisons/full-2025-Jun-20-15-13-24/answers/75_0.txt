Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features a patterned gown with no vase; the right model shows a floral gown with a vase and flowers. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a basic structure; the right model appears more complex with additional elements such as flowers and a vase, resembling a realistic scene. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's patterns align uniformly; the right modelâ€™s texture corresponds closely with its complex geometry, showing better adherence. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are simple and repetitive; the right model displays detailed and intricate textures. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has straightforward geometry; the right model has more detailed and varied geometry. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all factors, the right model is more accurate and detailed in fulfilling the prompt. The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
