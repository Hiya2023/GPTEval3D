Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures intricate patterns and colorful designs typical of a "vintage Chinese vase"; the right one is simpler with fewer details.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears well-shaped and detailed, but the right one looks more solid and realistic without distortions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has textures that align well with the geometry; the right one has inconsistent texture alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays rich and clear details; the right one lacks clear definition.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows elaborate geometry in the normal map; the right one is more simplistic.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all factors, the left one aligns better with the prompt and exhibits superior detail.
The left one is better.
