1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more subdued and vintage-like appearance, but lacks specific details typical of Chinese vases; The right one has vivid patterns and floral designs that are characteristic of traditional Chinese vases.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and natural, while the right one appears slightly exaggerated but still plausible in 3D form.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a consistent texture with its simpler shape; The right one shows good alignment, especially where floral patterns meet the vase's contours.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks distinct texture details and looks plain; The right one captures intricate pattern details effectively.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother geometry; The right one, while more detailed, shows complex patterns aligned with its structure.
The right one is better.
