Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left mask is vibrant with pronounced patterns and shapes that align well with "colorful African mask." The right mask is also colorful but lacks distinctive features. 
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left mask appears more solid and natural with its detailed shape and texture. The right mask looks flatter and less dimensional.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left mask's texture aligns well with its shape, highlighting features with clarity. The right mask's texture seems misaligned, with less coherence between RGB and normal maps.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left mask shows clear, defined patterns and intricate designs that are visually appealing. The right mask appears smoother and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left mask demonstrates more intricate and precise geometric details in the normal map. The right mask appears less detailed and organized.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left mask better fulfills the criteria of alignment with the text prompt, 3D plausibility, geometry-texture alignment, and detail richness.
   The left one is better.
