Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a more distinct and contemporary design, often seen in modern Scandinavian furniture, with clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic. The right model appears more traditional with darker tones and less distinctive Scandinavian styling.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and natural in its form, while the right model seems to have certain irregularities in design and structure, making it less plausible as a realistic chair.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows a good match between its geometric shape and the applied texture, with harmonious contours. The right model's texture seems misaligned, with inconsistencies between the RGB and normal images.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details effectively with clear textures that maintain the aesthetic, while the right model's textures are less distinct and slightly blurred.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents a more organized and smooth geometry, capturing intricate details without noise, unlike the right model which displays some disorganized structural details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the evaluated aspects, the left model better meets the criteria set forth by the text prompt and renders a more accurate representation of a modern Scandinavian chair.
The left one is better.
