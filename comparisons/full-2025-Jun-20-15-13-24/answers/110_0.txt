Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear chair structure relevant to the Scandinavian style, with distinct components like the seat, backrest, and legs.
   - The right one is abstract and doesn't resemble a chair.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears natural and plausible with clear chair-like proportions.
   - The right one lacks recognizable structure and coherence.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture aligns well with the chair geometry, providing a coherent structure.
   - The right one's texture and geometry do not align meaningfully.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures fine wood grain details typical of a chair.
   - The right one lacks detailed textures.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has well-organized geometry with clear lines and edges.
   - The right one has undefined geometry.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left model clearly outscores the right in all aspects.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
