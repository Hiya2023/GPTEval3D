Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one reflects a more conventional chair design, possibly aligning with Scandinavian style.
   - The right one appears less structured and doesn't clearly resemble a modern Scandinavian chair.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have more realistic proportions and solid structure.
   - The right one shows irregular shapes and seems less plausible as a structured object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture aligns better with its shape, maintaining coherence between RGB and normal images.
   - The right one lacks this alignment, with mismatched textures and shapes.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures more detailed textures that fit the aesthetic of the chair.
   - The right one is less detailed and appears abstract.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows clearer and more organized geometric details.
   - The right one has less defined geometric structures and more noise.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the left one consistently matches the text prompt and demonstrates better overall quality.
   - The left one is better.
