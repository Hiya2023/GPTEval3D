Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures more classic African mask features with vibrant colors and abstract patterns. The right one is more subdued and lacks distinct modern abstract influences.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one seems more natural and solid with a defined structure, while the right one appears less detailed and somewhat simplistic.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows better integration between the texture and geometry, matching the RGB and normal map details. The right's texture seems misaligned.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has richer and more intricate textures that capture fine details, whereas the right one appears more plain.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more detailed and organized geometry in the normal maps, while the right is smoother but lacks detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model excels in all evaluated aspects, effectively capturing the essence of the prompt with rich detail and good alignment.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
