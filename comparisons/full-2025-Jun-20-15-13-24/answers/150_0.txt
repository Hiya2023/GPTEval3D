   - The right one appears more vibrant and decorated, which doesn't align as well with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more natural and solid, with normal teapot proportions.
   - The right one has unnatural proportions and a more abstract look.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has textures and geometry that match well, giving a cohesive appearance.
   - The right one has mismatched colorful textures and geometry that do not align.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures subtle, rustic details effectively.
   - The right one has overly stylized textures that donâ€™t match the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one features smoother, more realistic geometry.
   - The right one displays noisy and less organized shapes.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all the criteria, the left one consistently aligns better with the text prompt and maintains better plausibility and cohesion.
