1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object includes both a gown and a vase, aligning with the prompt.
   - The right object only shows a gown.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has more intricate details but may suffer from some irregularities.
   - The right object appears more solid and plausible overall.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object has a more complex texture which aligns well with the geometry.
   - The right object has simpler textures but good alignment.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures fine details with vibrant textures.
   - The right object appears more uniform and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has detailed geometry that captures complex shapes.
   - The right object has smoother geometry but lacks intricate details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the left object covers more criteria effectively.
   The left one is better.
