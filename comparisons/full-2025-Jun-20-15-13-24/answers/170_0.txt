3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left oneâ€™s texture aligns with its shape; The right one's textures do not match the teapot form effectively.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures rustic details effectively; The right one appears blurry and ornate, losing the rustic feel.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smooth, well-defined geometry details; The right one has noisy and mismatched details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria above, the left one better captures the prompt and exhibits a coherent model.
