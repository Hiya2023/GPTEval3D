1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a more understated design, lacking clear Chinese artistic features. 
   - The right object features intricate floral patterns commonly associated with vintage Chinese vases.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has a generally solid appearance but lacks detail.
   - The right object appears more natural and has a well-defined structure.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object has texture that doesn't align well with the vase shape.
   - The right object demonstrates good alignment with consistent floral textures.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object's textures appear less detailed and somewhat blurry.
   - The right object captures detailed textures that are visually appealing.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object lacks intricate geometry details.
   - The right object exhibits more detailed geometric features.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right object effectively captures the essence of a vintage Chinese vase with detailed, plausible, and aligned textures and geometry.
   The right one is better.
