Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: The left model includes bright floral patterns but may not be minimalist. The right model has a simpler design with more refined engravings.  
   The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: The left model appears less natural with exaggerated textures, whereas the right model has smoother and more realistic proportions.  
   The right one is better.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: The left model's textures do not align well with its geometry, showing mismatched designs. The right model maintains consistent alignment.  
   The right one is better.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: The left model's textures are overly complex and less defined. The right model captures fine, clear details.  
   The right one is better.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: The left model has noisy geometry, while the right model shows well-organized and smooth details.  
   The right one is better.

6. **Overall**: The right model aligns better in all criteria.  
   The right one is better.
