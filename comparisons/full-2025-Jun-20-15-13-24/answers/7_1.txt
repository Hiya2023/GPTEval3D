The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one maintains natural and realistic proportions and solid structures for both objects. The right one has slightly distorted proportions, particularly in the teapot.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better alignment between the textures and the geometry, as both the dress and teapot follow their expected forms. The right one shows inconsistency, mainly on the teapot.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures fine details effectively, without appearing blurry. The right one has some blurred areas, particularly on the dress.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left oneâ€™s geometry is smooth and organized. The right one shows some noise and irregular structures.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left one offers a more accurate and visually appealing representation.
The left one is better.
