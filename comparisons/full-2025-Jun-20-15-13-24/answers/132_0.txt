Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a darker color and less defined structure; the right one has a more elegant, flowing shape that aligns with an evening gown description.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less cohesive with irregular proportions; the right one is more solid and natural-looking.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has less matching between texture and geometry; the right one shows a more consistent alignment between shape and appearance.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has less clarity in textures; the right one captures finer details more effectively.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks intricate geometric details; the right one presents a smoother and more refined structure.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model demonstrates better correspondence to the prompt, plausibility, and detailing.
The right one is better.
