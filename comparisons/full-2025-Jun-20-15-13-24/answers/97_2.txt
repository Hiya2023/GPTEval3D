Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more modern look with rounded shapes typical of Scandinavian design, while the right one has a more conventional form. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural with consistent and plausible proportions. The right model has some irregularities in shape. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures of the left model align well with its shape, especially on the seat and backrest. The right model shows some mismatches in texture alignment. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details more effectively, with richer textures on visible surfaces. The right model appears less detailed. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has well-defined geometry, especially noticeable in the details of the normal map. The right model's geometry is less intricate. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model consistently outperforms the right in alignment, plausibility, and detail. The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
