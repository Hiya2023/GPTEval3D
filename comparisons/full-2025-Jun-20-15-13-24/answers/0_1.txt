Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a simplified structure without detailed attributes like the ornate vase; the right object includes both the gown and a detailed vase. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object looks basic without texture cohesion; the right object appears more realistic with consistent detailing. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object has smooth textures without strong alignment; the right shows better integration of texture and geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object lacks intricate textures; the right object captures more fine details, like the fabric patterns and vase decor. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has a basic structure; the right object shows intricate geometry, especially in the gown's drapery and vase. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object aligns more closely with the text prompt and shows better texture and geometry details. The right one is better.
