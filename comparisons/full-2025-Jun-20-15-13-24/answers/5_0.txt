Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one captures a vibrant dress with colors and patterns, but lacks the teapot; The right one focuses more on a vibrant dress, also without a teapot.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has more detailed and natural dress proportions; The right one appears too simplistic.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's textures align well with geometry, particularly on the dress patterns; The right one is less detailed.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows detailed textures, especially in the dress fabric; The right one is less vibrant.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one contains detailed, coherent geometry; The right one is less complex.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria, the left one shows better details and alignment.
The left one is better.
