Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object shows a globe-like structure but with fragmented parts and a less defined pedestal.
   - The right object clearly depicts a solid spherical globe on a distinct cubic pedestal.
   
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears incomplete and fragmented, lacking a coherent structure.
   - The right object presents a plausible and solid 3D form with clear boundaries.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture is fragmented and lacks detail cohesion.
   - The right object shows smoother and more coherent textures, despite being less detailed.
   
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
