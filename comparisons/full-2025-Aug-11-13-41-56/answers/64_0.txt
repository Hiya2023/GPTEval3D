Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a rectangular sign, which does not match the "triangular road sign" description. 
   - The right one is more triangular in shape, aligning better with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has an appropriate, simple structure but is not triangular.
   - The right one appears more irregular but maintains a triangular form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has mismatched textures for its rectangular shape.
   - The right one's textures follow the triangular form more closely.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has less clear detail and appears slightly blurred.
   - The right one, although busy, captures more detail in the textures.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one exhibits a simpler, smooth structure but lacks detail.
   - The right one has visible geometric details consistent with its textures.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all the criteria, the right one aligns better with the prompt and exhibits better texture and geometry alignment.
   - The right one is better.
