Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more trapezoidal shape and resembles a shelf with multiple divisions; the right one appears more fragmented and less like a bookshelf.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more coherent shape and structure; the right one has missing parts and seems less solid.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one aligns textures with the trapezoidal shape better; the right one's textures seem misaligned with irregular geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows clear textures and structures, while the right one appears noisy and less defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits a clearly defined shape with better organization; the right one is irregular and lacks structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left one maintains consistency across criteria and better reflects the intended design.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
