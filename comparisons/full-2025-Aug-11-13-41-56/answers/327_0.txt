Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left model (object 1) resembles a coffee table but appears somewhat uneven. It is square but lacks detail.
   - The right model (object 2) has a more traditional coffee table appearance with ornate legs, fitting the "square coffee table" description well.
   - The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - The left model (object 1) looks solid but lacks detail, making it less realistic.
   - The right model (object 2) appears well-structured and consistent, with more realistic proportions.
   - The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 
   - The left model (object 1) has a smooth texture but lacks detail and sharpness.
   - The right model (object 2) shows more detailed and realistic texture.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
