Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object resembles a traditional spherical doorknob with clear definition and finish.
   - The right object is also spherical but lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object looks solid and proportionate, resembling a real doorknob.
   - The right object appears less defined and less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object’s textures align well with its shape.
   - The right object’s alignment is less congruent.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left object shows clearer and more defined textures.
   - The right object’s textures appear vague.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left object displays smoothness and precision.
   - The right object lacks intricate detail.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one reflects the prompt more accurately, is geometrically coherent, and has better texture detail.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
