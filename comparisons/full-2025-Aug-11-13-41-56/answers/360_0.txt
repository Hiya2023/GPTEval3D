Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a round cushion with clear cushion-like features.
   - The right one appears more irregular and less like a cushion.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and consistent with normal cushion structure.
   - The right one looks uneven with strange textures that don't resemble a cushion.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed and clear textures that resemble fabric.
   - The right one has less clear and less realistic texture detail.
   The left one is better.
