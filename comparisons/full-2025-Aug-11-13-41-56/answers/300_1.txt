Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a visible hexagonal shape that aligns with the "hexagonal table," but it's unclear if there's a mirror component.
   - The right model also has a hexagonal appearance but lacks clear features of a mirror.
   - Cannot decide which better covers all text prompt attributes.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and coherent as a 3D object with defined edges.
   - The right model seems less structured with irregularities and less focus.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has sharper textures, especially noticeable in the table's detail.
   - The right model's textures appear more noisy and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
