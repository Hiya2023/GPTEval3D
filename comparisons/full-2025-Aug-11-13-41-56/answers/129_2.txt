Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one accurately represents a cubic ottoman with clear cubic structure and plain color; the right one has an unclear shape and vibrant pattern. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears solid and natural with proper proportions; the right one looks distorted and doesn't represent a plausible structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with its cubic shape; the right one's texture is misaligned and chaotic.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clear texture without blurriness; the right one appears overly abstract with no clear details.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a clean and smooth geometry; the right one features noisy and unorganized details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left one consistently satisfies all criteria.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
