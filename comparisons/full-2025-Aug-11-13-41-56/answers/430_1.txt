Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object appears to be more detailed with a textured surface and layered design, but its shape is not fully spherical.
   - The right object is a simple sphere on a base, aligning well with the prompt "A spherical doorknob."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has a complex structure that might not be as solid or normal for a typical doorknob.
   - The right object is straightforward, smooth, and plausible as a doorknob.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more intricate textures and details.
   - The right object's texture is smoother and lacks detailed features.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
