Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- The left object features a hexagonal-shaped top which likely represents the table, with a somewhat reflective or dark object above that could be interpreted as the mirror. The table's design does meet the basic requirement of being hexagonal.

- The right object shows a clearly hexagonal table and a more defined circular shape above the table indicating a mirroring surface. The mirror appears more prominently aligned with the prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
