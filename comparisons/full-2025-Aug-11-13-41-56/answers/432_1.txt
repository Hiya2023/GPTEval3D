Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a rectangular form but lacks clear features of a sofa and the presence of a round stool is unclear.
   - The right one appears to resemble a sofa more clearly with cushions but does not clearly show a stool.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems irregular, with a distorted and incomplete structure.
   - The right one appears more cohesive and solid, resembling a plausible 3D model of a sofa.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a wooden texture that is repetitive and not very detailed.
   - The right one exhibits a fabric-like texture with visible cushions, and appears more realistic and detailed.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
