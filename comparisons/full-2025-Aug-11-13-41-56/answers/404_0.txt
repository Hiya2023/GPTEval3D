Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left model has a circular seating surface but doesn't have a clear square base. The right model seems to follow the circular and square base concept better with a clearer distinction between the seat and base.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears to have odd, duplicate features and less cohesion, while the right model is simpler and more structurally coherent.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left model has more texture detailing, though it seems noisy. The right model is smoother and lacks some detail but appears cleaner.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 1
