Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more like a traditional round cushion with a smooth, fluffed appearance that matches what one might expect from the description.
   - The right one has a more irregular surface and doesn't convey the typical appearance of a cushion as well.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more solid, smooth, and consistent with an actual cushion shape.
   - The right one seems irregular and has unusual structural elements that make it less plausible as a cushion.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother and more realistic texture that resembles fabric.
   - The right one's texture lacks the smoothness and fine detail typically found in cushions.
   - The left one is better.
