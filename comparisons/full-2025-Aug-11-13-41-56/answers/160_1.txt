Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object appears more rectangular with defined cylindrical armrests, matching the prompt better.
   - The right object seems less distinct in shape and armrest features.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object has a clearer, more plausible shape with identifiable sofa features.
   - The right object is less structured and lacks clarity.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object shows better alignment between texture and geometry, maintaining recognizable sofa features.
   - The right object lacks this coherence.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left object captures more detailed textures with visible armrest features.
   - The right object's textures are less defined and blurrier.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left object has more intricate and organized geometry, representing the sofa accurately.
   - The right object has noisier and less meaningful geometry.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria:
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
