Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more intricate design with carved legs that don't fully match the simplicity of "a square coffee table." The right one captures the straightforward essence of a square table better.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one seems less stable with its ornate legs, while the right one has more plausible dimensions and structure for a functional table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has textures that align with its geometry but the complexity doesn't fit the prompt. The right one has simpler but fitting textures.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has detailed textures, but they seem overly complex. The right one, while simple, matches the aesthetic needed.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows more intricate geometry, which might be excessive. The right one is simpler and well-aligned with the expected design.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria, the right one better represents "a square coffee table."
The right one is better.
