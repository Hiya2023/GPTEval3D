Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a traditional lamp with a noticeable curved base but does not appear cubic.
   - The right one is more cubic but lacks a defined curved base and clear features.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model is solid and lamp-like, with consistent shapes and no apparent strange features.
   - The right model seems less structured and has undefined, noisy areas.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has sharper textures and a more realistic appearance with detailed coloring.
   - The right modelâ€™s texture is fuzzy and lacks detail.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
