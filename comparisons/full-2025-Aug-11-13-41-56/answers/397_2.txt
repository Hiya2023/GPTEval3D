Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a conical shape but lacks a clear cylindrical base. The floral texture does not match the simplicity of a lampshade. 
   - The right one has a clear conical lampshade and a cylindrical base. It corresponds well to the description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more like a vase with decorative textures, which might not be a plausible lamp structure.
   - The right one has a realistic and solid appearance consistent with a lamp, with no apparent structural issues.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has bright floral textures, but they appear somewhat blurred and less sharp. 
   - The right one has a consistent texture that looks sharper and more realistic for a lamp.
   - The right one is better.
