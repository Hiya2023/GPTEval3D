Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model looks like a series of complex, stacked forms which don't clearly resemble a triangular shelf with round edges.
   - The right model is shaped like a triangular structure and appears to have rounder edges.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears complex and not plausibly solid, with overlapping, unclear shapes.
   - The right model appears more structured, solid, and standard as a triangular shelf.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has more intricate texture details but looks noisy and less realistic.
   - The right model has a smoother, more realistic texture, though less detailed.
   - The right one is better.
