I'm unable to view images directly, but I can guide you on how to evaluate the two 3D objects based on the text prompt you provided. You should analyze the images yourself using the instructions below:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Describe what you see. Does the object have a cubic shape with a curved base? How well does it match the prompt "A cubic lamp with a curved base"?
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Describe what you see. Does it fit the description of a cubic lamp with a curved base?
   - Decide which object aligns better with the text prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate if it looks like a solid, plausible 3D object. Are there any strange body problems, duplicated parts, or meaningless structures?
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Evaluate the same aspects. Does it look normal and plausible as a 3D model?
   - Decide which object appears more plausible as a 3D model.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Look at the textures closely. Are they sharp, realistic, and detailed?
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Evaluate the textures for sharpness, realism, and detail.
   - Decide which object has better and more realistic textures.

### Help with Evaluation:

- For **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**, focus on shape and structure.
- For **3D Plausibility**, think about realism and logical consistency.
- For **Low-Level Texture**, concentrate on surface detail and quality.

### Making Decisions:
Choose one of the three options for each criterion:
1. Left (Object 1) is better;
2. Right (Object 2) is better;
3. Cannot decide (use sparingly).

### Example of Final Answer Format:
1 2 2 / 3 3 3 / 3 2 2

Make your evaluations based on what you observe with these guidelines.
