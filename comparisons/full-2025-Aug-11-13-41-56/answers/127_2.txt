Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object shows a clearer trapezoidal shape with multiple shelves, aligning closely with the text prompt. The right object appears less trapezoidal and more like a simple ladder with shelves.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has consistent proportions and a solid structure. The right object, however, seems unstable with irregular proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's shelves and shape have textures that align well, matching the geometry effectively. The right object shows some misalignment between shape and texture.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object displays clearer and more refined textures, whereas the right object appears blurred and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits intricate details in the normal map, with smooth and organized structures. The right object shows more noisy inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left object demonstrates superior alignment with the prompt and quality.
The left one is better.
