Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: Features a conical shape but lacks a distinct cylindrical base. The design appears floral.
   - The right one: Clearly depicts a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one: The structure resembles a vase more than a lamp, lacking a clear base, and the conical form isn't prominent.
   - The right one: Appears more structurally plausible as a lamp with distinct components.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Features detailed floral decorations with a variety of colors.
   - The right one: Consists of a realistic texture with appropriate lighting effects, though less detailed.
   - The left one is better.
