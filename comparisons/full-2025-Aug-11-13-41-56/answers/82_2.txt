Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more complex structure and does not accurately match the text description of a "conical lampshade on a cylindrical base" because the shape is more of a twisted form rather than a simple cone and cylinder. The right one accurately represents a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has an overly complex and unnatural twisted form, appearing less solid and plausible as a typical lampshade. The right object maintains the expected proportions and shapes, looking more like a typical lamp. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object’s texture does not align well with the twisted geometry, while the right object’s texture and shape align appropriately, matching the expected appearance. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has intricate textures, but they appear overly detailed and abstract for a lampshade. The right object maintains simplicity but within the appropriate context for the object type, which is better in this case. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is overly complicated and not well organized for the intended shape. The right object has smooth and clear geometry that aligns well with the normal maps. The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right model best matches the described lampshade. The right one is better.
