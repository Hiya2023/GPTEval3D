Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one accurately captures a circular stool with a square base, as described. The right one does not have a clear square base. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more natural and solid structure that resembles a real stool. The right one appears distorted and less plausible. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: On the left, the texture aligns well with the geometry, maintaining cohesion. The right one shows misaligned textures and inconsistent form. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clear, realistic textures. The right one features overly abstract and colorful textures. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays smooth and well-organized geometry. The right one has noisy and disorganized geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all criteria, the left one effectively captures the prompt and presents a more coherent model. The left one is better.
