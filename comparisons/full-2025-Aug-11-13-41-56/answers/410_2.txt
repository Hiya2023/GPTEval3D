Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a round shape, but the texture seems rough and uneven.
   - The right one also has a round shape, appearing more like a cushion with a smooth top surface and colorful patterns.
   - The right one is better as it aligns more closely with the description of "a round cushion."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have an irregular surface that may not be plausible for a solid object.
   - The right one looks more solid and consistent with its smoother, rounded shape.
   - The right one is better regarding 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one's texture seems monotonous and lacks detail.
   - The right one has more detailed and realistic textures with visible patterns and colors.
   - The right one is better in terms of low-level texture.

Final answer:
