Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is a simple cubic shape which reflects the "cubic ottoman" prompt better. The right one has a texture that distracts from the cubic form.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more structured and solid. The right one has irregular and noisy texture patterns that affect its natural appearance.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with its cubic form. The right one's texture seems misaligned with its geometry, lacking coherence.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures the texture simplicity suitable for an ottoman. The right one appears noisy and overly complex.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a well-organized structure with no apparent noise. The right one has chaotic geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one maintains a consistent cubic form, appropriate textures, and organized geometry.
The left one is better.
