Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to have a more ornate design on the legs, which may not entirely match the straightforward concept of a "square coffee table." However, it generally maintains a square shape.
   - The right model seems to more closely represent a simple square coffee table, with a clearer square shape and legs that are more typical for such a design.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model's legs are detailed, but the overall shape seems less structurally sound due to irregularities in the tabletop surface.
   - The right model appears more solid and plausible, with a smooth tabletop that indicates a normal, sturdy coffee table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has sharper, more detailed texture on the legs; however, the tabletop looks inconsistently detailed.
   - The right model's textures are more uniform across the surface, providing a more realistic appearance throughout.
   - The right one is better.
