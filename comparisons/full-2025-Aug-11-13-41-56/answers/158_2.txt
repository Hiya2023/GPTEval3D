Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears as a smooth, round cushion aligning well with the text prompt. The right object has a textured and patterned appearance, which does not match "a round cushion" as closely. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object maintains a consistent round shape from all angles, while the right object has irregular textures and shapes. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object showcases consistent texture and geometry alignment, while the right object shows misalignment with noisy patterns not resembling a cushion. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has smooth and cohesive textures fitting a cushionâ€™s surface. The right object has overly complex textures that appear unrealistic. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has smoother geometry, resembling a real cushion, while the right object has erratic details and inconsistent geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria, the left object is more aligned with the text prompt and displays better quality in terms of shape, texture, and geometry.
