Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is uniformly colored without detailed patterning, resembling more of an organic shape. The right one has a floral pattern, which although not explicitly mentioned, adds a decorative element typical of cushions. However, the right one more closely resembles a cushion due to its textile-like texture. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears as a uniform lump whereas the right one portrays a more realistic cushion shape. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The right one shows a better alignment with the flower pattern conforming well to the cushion shape, unlike the left object's more abstract texture. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right one displays intricate floral details, whereas the left one lacks texture detail. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry appears less refined with a consistent, rough surface, while the right one has more texture cohesion that enhances structural perception. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better fulfills the criteria for a "round cushion" with its realistic shape, texture alignment, and details. The right one is better.
