Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one does not clearly depict a sofa, with abstract shapes and no clear armrests; The right one accurately represents a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less coherent with irregular structures; The right one appears more natural and solid.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one lacks clear alignment between geometry and texture; The right one shows good alignment with clear distinctions in shape and texture.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks detail and is blurry; The right one has sharp textures and better detail.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has muddled geometry; The right one has more precise and intentional shapes.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model adheres more closely to all criteria.
The right one is better.
