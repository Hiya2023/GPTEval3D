Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (Object 1) has an elliptical tabletop and circular legs, well aligned with the description.

   While both align well, the right object's lighter texture could provide a clearer depiction.

The right one is slightly better.

Final answer:
2
