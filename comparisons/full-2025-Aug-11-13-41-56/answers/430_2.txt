Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has intricate details and structure, which makes it look less spherical and more like an ornate embellishment.
   - The right one is a simple, clean spherical shape that aligns well with the description of a "spherical doorknob."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems complex with many details, which might suggest duplication and noise challenges when imagined as a 3D object.
   - The right one appears straightforward, solid, and plausible with a clear spherical shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a rich and textured appearance with visible intricate details.
   - The right one has a more uniform and smooth surface without intricate details but with good reflection and shading.
   - The left one is better.
