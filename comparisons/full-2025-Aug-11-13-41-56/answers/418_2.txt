Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to be a tall, narrow bookshelf, aligned more with the "rectangular bookshelf" prompt due to its upright and conventional shape.
   - The right model is shorter and broader, which might not fully align with a typical "rectangular" bookshelf.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model seems more solid and structured, with a clear depiction of shelves and no apparent structural issues.
   - The right model looks less stable with potentially irregular shelf spacing and form, leading to a less plausible 3D structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model exhibits sharper and more detailed textures, particularly in the depiction of books and shelf edges.
   - The right modelâ€™s texture appears less refined, with fewer details.
   - The left one is better.
