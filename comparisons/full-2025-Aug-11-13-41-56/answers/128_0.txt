Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more like a rectangular bookshelf with clearly defined shelves and rectangular shape. The right one has more distortion and uneven surfaces.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more structurally sound and stable, resembling a plausible bookshelf. The right one seems irregular and less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has textures that align well with the bookshelf's geometry. The right one has textures that are misaligned and inconsistent.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows clearer, sharp texture details that better match the bookshelf's form. The right one is more blurry and less defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has more consistent and smooth geometry. The right one has noisy and rough geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left one consistently performs better in alignment, plausibility, and detail.
The left one is better.
