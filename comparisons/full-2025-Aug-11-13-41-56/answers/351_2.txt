Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model displays a clear conical lampshade on a cylindrical base, which fits the text description very well.
   - The right model seems to have a more vase-like appearance with floral textures and does not clearly represent a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears visually coherent and solid, fitting the concept of a lamp well without any strange structural issues.
   - The right model, while creatively interesting, does not convincingly portray a plausible lampshade and base setup; it appears more decorative and less structured.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a simpler texture but maintains a realistic look consistent with a lamp, though not highly detailed.
   - The right model features intricate floral details, providing a richer and more detailed texture.
   - The right one is better.
