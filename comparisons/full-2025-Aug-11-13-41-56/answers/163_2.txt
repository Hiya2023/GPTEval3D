I'm unable to directly evaluate or describe images. However, I can guide you on how to perform the evaluation based on the criteria provided. Hereâ€™s how you can proceed:

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left**: Examine whether the model resembles "a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests" and captures the attributes described.
   - **Right**: Do the same for this model.
   - Decide which one better aligns with the prompt.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left**: Assess the naturalness and solidity from different viewpoints; look for any abnormalities.
   - **Right**: Evaluate similarly for this model.
   - Decide which model appears more plausible.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - **Left**: Check if the texture and geometry match accurately.
   - **Right**: Evaluate this aspect for the right model.
   - Decide which better aligns.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - **Left**: Focus on the detail and clarity of textures.
   - **Right**: Compare the same aspect for this model.
   - Decide which has superior texture details.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - **Left**: Look for intricate, well-defined geometry in the normal maps.
   - **Right**: Assess this for the right model.
   - Decide which has better geometry details.

6. **Overall Decision**:
   - Combine the analysis to determine which is better overall.

### Final Answer:
Make your decision for each criterion and summarize, e.g., "1 2 1 1 2 1".
