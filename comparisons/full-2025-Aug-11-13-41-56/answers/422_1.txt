Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one does not resemble a lamp or a cubic shape. It looks more like a hollow ring or circular structure which deviates from the text prompt of "a cubic lamp with a curved base."
   - The right one clearly depicts a cubic lamp with a distinct light source and a base, aligning much closer to the text prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have an unusual and implausible shape for a lamp, with no clear indication of solidity or functionality.
   - The right one looks more practical and plausible as a lamp, with a defined cubic shape and a proper base.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has noticeable texture details but not relevant to a lamp structure.
   - The right one exhibits sharper and more appropriate textures for a lamp, with visible lighting effects and surface details.
   The right one is better.
