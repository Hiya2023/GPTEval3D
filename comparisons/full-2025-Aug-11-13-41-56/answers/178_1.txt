Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a simple white surface with circular legs, while the right one has a more detailed texture but may not precisely represent an elliptical shape. The left one better matches the "elliptical coffee table with circular legs".
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more consistent and realistic as a coffee table, while the right one displays some irregularities in the proportions and shapes.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture is simple and aligns with the geometry. The right model has a more detailed texture, but it is inconsistent with its geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right model has more detail in textures, but it may not serve the prompt. The left is simplistic but clear.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model portrays smooth and consistent geometry, while the right displays unnecessary noise and irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering most criteria, the left model better fits the requirements and provides a cleaner, more plausible representation.
The left one is better.


Final answer:
1 1 1 2 1 1
