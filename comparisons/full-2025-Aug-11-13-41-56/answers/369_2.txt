Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one features a conical lampshade but the base is not clearly cylindrical.
   - The right one clearly shows a conical lampshade and a cylindrical base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid but lacks clarity in the base's shape.
   - The right one is more coherent, with no obvious structural issues.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more defined texture with more noticeable details.
   - The right one has softer textures and less detail.
   - The left one is better.
