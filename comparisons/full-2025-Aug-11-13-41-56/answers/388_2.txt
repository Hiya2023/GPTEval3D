Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model has a round seat and round base, but the base doesn't appear square.
   - The right model has a circular seat and more of a square base, aligning better with "a circular stool with a square base."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks solid and coherent, but the intricate textures might create a slightly noisy appearance.
   - The right model appears more stable and realistic, without strange body parts or inconsistencies.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows detailed textures, especially on the base and seat, though slightly noisy.
   - The right model has cleaner and more realistic textures with less noise.
   - The right one is better.
