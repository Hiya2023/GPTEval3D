Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more distinct oval shape for the table, while the right appears more circular. The left one better aligns with the "oval dining table" prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and solid in structure, with consistent proportions, while the right one has a less defined shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better alignment of texture to geometry, as textures clearly follow the tableâ€™s shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures more intricate texture details on the surface, adding depth and realism.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one exhibits more refined details in its geometry, visible in the normal maps.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left appears more accurate to the prompt, more plausible, and with better detail and alignment in both texture and geometry.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
