Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more abstract and does not clearly resemble a cushion. The right one, although floral, more closely resembles a cushion shape. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks more like an irregular, undefined form, whereas the right one seems more solid and structure resembles a cushion. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one and right one both incorporate texture, but the right one's pattern aligns better with the cushion shape. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks distinct texture details. The right one has floral details which are more defined. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry is basic and lacks detail, while the right one has more defined and varied geometric detail. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one more closely resembles a plausible cushion based on the description. The right one is better.
