Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more like a rectangular shelf, which does not align with the "triangular" shape specified in the prompt.
   - The right one is a triangular structure, closely matching the "triangular shelf with round edges."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object seems to be a more conventional structure, but its shape does not adhere to the prompt.
   - The right object represents a more plausible triangular structure with its round edges.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left object has darker wood textures that appear less clear.
   - The right object shows more refined and realistic textures on its surfaces.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
