Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a circular top and a round base, which doesn't fit the prompt of having a square base.
   - The right one has a circular seat with a square base, aligning better with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks a bit unstable with its narrow base and has some color inconsistencies.
   - The right one appears more stable and solid with a reasonable base structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more vibrant colors but looks less realistic with its textures.
   - The right one appears to have a more realistic texture even if it's less colorful.
   - The right one is better.
