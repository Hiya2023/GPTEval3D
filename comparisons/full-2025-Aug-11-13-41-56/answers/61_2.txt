Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a smoother and more spherical appearance, aligning better with the doorknob description. The right model shows more irregularities and doesn't fully capture the spherical shape.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and solid, with consistent proportions. The right model has more distortions and uneven features, making it less believable as a solid object.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left modelâ€™s texture aligns smoothly with its geometry, while the right model has mismatches between texture and shape, with visible disruptions.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures the metallic texture cleanly without blurriness. The right model has less defined textures and appears more chaotic.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model displays smoother and more organized geometry, while the right model appears irregular, with unnecessary noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model better aligns with the prompt, demonstrating superior structure, texture alignment, and detail accuracy.
The left one is better.
