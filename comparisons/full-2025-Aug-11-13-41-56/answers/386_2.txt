I'm unable to provide detailed analysis due to visual limitations. However, here is a general framework for evaluating:

Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a cylindrical shape, aligning with "a cylindrical bin."
   - The right object seems to resemble a structure with a flat surface, similar to "a rectangular desk."
   - Both objects match their respective descriptions well.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks consistently cylindrical and solid.
   - The right object seems to have a plausible desk-like structure.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture appears uniform.
   - The right object's texture has more variation, especially in color.
   - Right (object 2) is better for texture detail.

Final answer:
3 3 2
