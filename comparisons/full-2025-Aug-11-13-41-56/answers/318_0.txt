Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a rectangular shelf with straight edges and multiple tiers. It does not match the prompt of a "triangular shelf with round edges."
   - The right one is a triangular structure with some rounded elements, aligning better with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to be a plausible and solid bookshelf, although not aligned with the prompt.
   - The right one, while triangular, looks less solid and structurally sound.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows a more defined texture, particularly on the shelving surfaces.
   - The right one has less distinct texture detail.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
