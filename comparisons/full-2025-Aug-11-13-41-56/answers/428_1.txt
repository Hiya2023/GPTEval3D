Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a spherical shape on a structure resembling a pedestal. However, the base appears more cylindrical than cubic.
   - The right one also has a spherical shape on a pedestal. The base is more visually cubic.
   - The right one is better as it more closely aligns with the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a consistent form and seems more solid, although the base shape is slightly off.
   - The right one also appears plausible, with a clearer cubic base, but might have less detail in solidity.
   - Cannot decide; both have strengths in different aspects.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one displays smoother and more detailed texture.
   - The right one lacks sharpness and detail in its texture.
   - The left one is better in terms of texture.
