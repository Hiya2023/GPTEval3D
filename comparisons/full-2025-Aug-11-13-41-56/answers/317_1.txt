Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a rectangular road sign, which does not align with the description of "a triangular road sign."
   - The right object resembles a triangular road sign, matching the prompt more closely.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears to have a solid structure typical of a metal road sign, with no visible distortions.
   - The right object also seems structurally sound, with a clear triangular shape and plausible design features.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more readable text and clearer details for the sign, suggesting better texture.
   - The right object has bright colors but lacks fine detail compared to the left one.
   - The left one is better.
