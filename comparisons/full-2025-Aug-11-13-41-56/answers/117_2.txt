Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a clearer trapezoidal shape with distinct shelves; the right model is less defined.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and structured, while the right model seems jagged with inconsistent proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has more consistent alignment between texture and geometry; the right shows mismatch.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clearer textures and appears less blurry; the right lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model demonstrates better-organized details; the right appears noisy and less refined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one is more accurate and coherent.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
