Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one seems to have a spherical object but lacks a clear cubic pedestal.
   - The right one has a clearer spherical globe and a visible pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears less coherent, with disjoint elements and lacking solidity.
   - The right one looks more solid and plausible as a proper 3D object with defined shapes.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has unclear, washed-out textures.
   - The right one has sharper textures and clearer detail.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
