Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more diamond-shaped and doesn't closely resemble a triangle.
   - The right one has a clearer triangular shape that matches the prompt "A triangular road sign."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems less stable and the shape is inconsistent across views.
   - The right one appears more solid and consistent, adhering better to a plausible triangular form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a rough texture with less detail visible.
   - The right one has sharper textures with more detail, particularly visible in the triangular structure.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
