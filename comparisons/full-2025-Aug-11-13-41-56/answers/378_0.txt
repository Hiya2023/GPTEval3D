Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a more intricate design with circular patterns but does not clearly resemble a cubic lamp with a curved base. 
   - The right one resembles a cubic lamp shape with a clear curved base, matching the text prompt better.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a more abstract shape and may not be perceived as a plausible, solid object.
   - The right one appears more structured and plausible, resembling a typical lamp with solid construction.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more complex textures with vivid colors, but it is less realistic.
   - The right one has a more natural and realistic texture with wood-like details, appearing sharper.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
