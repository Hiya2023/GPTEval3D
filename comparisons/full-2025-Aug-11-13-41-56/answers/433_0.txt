I'm unable to view specific details in images or directly analyze them. However, I can guide you on how to assess the images based on the criteria you provided:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: Evaluate whether the tables appear to be "oval dining tables." Check if the shapes and features are consistent with an oval dining table description. A table with more of the expected oval shape and dining table characteristics (like appropriate height and surface area) aligns better.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Look for realistic shapes and structures. Identify whether the tables have logical and proportional components (e.g., legs are sound and the tabletop stable). Check for unusual duplications, distortions, or unrealistic features.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: Focus on the clarity and detail of the textures. A table with sharper, more detailed textures on the wood or surface seems more realistic.

Use these guidelines to make your assessments based on the images you have.
