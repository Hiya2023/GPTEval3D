Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (Object 1): The object appears hexagonal but lacks a clear triangular frame as described in the text prompt. The overall structure doesn't strongly convey a mirror or distinct frame.
   - Right (Object 2): The object maintains a more hexagonal shape with hints of a triangular frame. However, it still doesn't clearly define a mirror or distinct framing as described.

The right one is better aligned with the description of a hexagonal mirror with a triangular frame.

Final answer:
2
