Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is colorful and patterned, but its shape is not entirely cubic.
   - The right one appears more cubic and simple, fitting better with the "cubic ottoman" prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is detailed and solid, despite its irregular shape.
   - The right one is simpler but may appear less solid due to less detail.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper and more detailed texture.
   - The right one has a smoother but less detailed texture.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
