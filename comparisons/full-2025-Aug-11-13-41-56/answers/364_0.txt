Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more cubic shape and better matches the description of a "cubic ottoman."
   - The right one has a less defined cubic form, appearing more rounded or irregular.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks solid and appropriately shaped for an ottoman, with a consistent form across views.
   - The right one seems less regular in its form, which may indicate less plausibility as a solid object.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a more detailed and sharper texture, exhibiting more realistic fabric qualities.
   - The right one's texture appears darker and less detailed.
   The left one is better.
