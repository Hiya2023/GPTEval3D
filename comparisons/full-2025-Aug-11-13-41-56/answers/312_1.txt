Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have a more detailed and embellished structure that resembles a classic spherical doorknob, with a noticeable base and a spherical form.
   - The right object is simpler and more purely spherical without additional features like a base.
   
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks more solid and has a defined structure that resembles a doorknob, but it is somewhat complex.
   - The right object is more minimalistic and lacks structural detail, making it less plausible as a complete doorknob.
   
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has richer texture details, with reflective surfaces and clearer details.
   - The right object is more smooth and lacks the detailed texture found on the left.
   
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
