Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has detailed elements such as ornate legs, but the table shape is unclear. The right one has a clearer square shape but lacks intricate detailing.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more complex but less structured, while the right one has a solid, simple structure more akin to a table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model displays a mismatch with uneven textures, whereas the right one has more uniform texture application.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left has intricate surface texture, but it looks noisy. The right model is cleaner but lacks detail.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left has more intricate geometry, but it appears distorted. The right one is simpler but consistent.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model captures the idea of "a square coffee table" more effectively in terms of structure and alignment.
The right one is better.
