Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a more ornate design but deviates from the simplicity implied by "a square coffee table."
   - The right object is simpler and aligns better with the prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears to have irregular proportions with overly decorative elements.
   - The right object has natural proportions more typical of a coffee table.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's textures are detailed but don't align smoothly with its geometry.
   - The right object shows better alignment between texture and geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures detailed textures, but they contribute to an overly complex appearance.
   - The right object’s textures are simple but more effective for the prompt.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has intricate geometry that isn't necessary for the concept.
   - The right object’s geometry is clear and fitting.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right object consistently aligns with the prompt and maintains clarity and simplicity.
   The right one is better.
