Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model has a clear rectangular shape with cylindrical armrests, which aligns well with the text prompt.
   - The right model also appears to be a sofa with armrests, but the shape seems less defined compared to the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks well-structured and solid, with no apparent strange body problems or duplicated parts.
   - The right model seems less solid, with some unclear structures that do not fit well with a plausible sofa.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a clearer, more detailed texture with distinct colors and patterns.
   - The right modelâ€™s texture appears less detailed and more uniform.
   - The left one is better.
