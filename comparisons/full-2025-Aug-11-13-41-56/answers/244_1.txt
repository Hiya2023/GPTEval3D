Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (object 1): The object is a hexagon which aligns well with the "hexagonal mirror" part of the prompt. However, it lacks a triangular frame which is an important part of the description.
   - Right (object 2): The overall shape appears more diamond-like, attempting to include a frame but lacks the hexagonal shape specified in the prompt. The frame does not align with the triangular description.
