Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a triangular shape with a detailed pattern, matching a typical road sign with a pole.
   - The right model also has a triangular shape but appears more abstract and less structured.
   - The left one is better in terms of clearly depicting a triangular road sign.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more structured and realistic, with no obvious strange body problems.
   - The right model appears less defined and more abstract, leading to lower plausibility.
   - The left one is more normal, solid, and plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has more detailed and varied textures, especially on the triangular part and pole.
   - The right model's texture appears softer and less defined.
   - The left one has sharper and more realistic textures.
