Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1):** The table has an oval shape, but the base is more like a pedestal and may not fully fit the dining table style.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The table is oval and has a more traditional dining table style with four legs, closely matching the text prompt.
   - **Decision:** The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (Object 1):** The model is round and lacks solidity, with an unclear base structure.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The model appears more stable and realistic with distinct legs and a solid structure.
   - **Decision:** The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (Object 1):** The texture is less detailed and appears fuzzy.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The texture is sharper and more detailed, particularly on the tabletop.
   - **Decision:** The right one is better.

Final answer:
