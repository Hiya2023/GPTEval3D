Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The model shows a rectangular sofa, which aligns well with the prompt description. There is, however, no visible oval mirror.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The model resembles a decorative chair or sofa rather than a rectangular sofa. An oval mirror is not present.

Given that the left model accurately depicts a rectangular sofa and the right model does not fit the described objects well, the left one is better.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
