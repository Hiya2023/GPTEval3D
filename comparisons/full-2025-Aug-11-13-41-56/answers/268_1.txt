Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one (object 1): Shows a rectangular sofa, but an oval mirror is not visible.
   - The right one (object 2): Displays a rectangular sofa, and an oval mirror is also not visible.
   
Both models fail to include the oval mirror mentioned in the prompt. Since both focus primarily on the sofa, it is challenging to determine superiority based on the prompt requirements.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
