Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one shows a more distinct round shape (stool) beside a rectangular shape (sofa), matching the prompt. The right one lacks clear distinction between two different objects.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and normal with clear structure and defined shapes. The right one seems less cohesive with a fuzzier appearance, making it less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has sharper and more detailed textures, making it more realistic. The right one appears blurred and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1
