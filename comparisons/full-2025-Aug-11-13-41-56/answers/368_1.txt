Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a floral texture and conical shape but lacks a distinct cylindrical base, resembling more of a vase or jar.
   - The right one has a clear conical lampshade and distinguishable cylindrical base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears less plausible as a conical lampshade with a base due to its vase-like appearance.
   - The right one looks more like a typical lampshade, with clear, plausible geometry.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has vibrant, detailed floral textures that stand out.
   - The right one has simpler, striped textures that are less detailed.
   - The left one is better.
