Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple spherical shape which directly aligns with the text prompt "a spherical doorknob."
   - The right one has a more elaborate design with details and embellishments, which may not strictly represent "spherical" as described in the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears to be a solid and plausible representation of a spherical object, adhering to a simple and realistic shape.
   - The right model, while intricate, has a more complex structure that might introduce unnecessary details which distract from the basic form of a doorknob.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a smoother finish with less texture detail.
   - The right model showcases a rich detailed texture that appears more realistic and complex.
   - The right one is better.
