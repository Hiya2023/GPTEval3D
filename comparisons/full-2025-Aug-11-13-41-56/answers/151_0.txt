**Analysis:**

1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**:
   - **Left**: Appears closer to a traditional rectangular sofa with cylindrical elements on the armrests.
   - **Right**: Sofa appears less rectangular and does not capture the cylindrical aspect well.
   - **The left one is better.**

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left**: Proportions seem more natural for a sofa, and the overall shape seems more stable.
   - **Right**: Looks less plausible with odd proportions.
   - **The left one is better.**

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**:
   - **Left**: Texture aligns relatively well with the geometry.
   - **Right**: Significant misalignment between the shape and texture.
   - **The left one is better.**

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**:
   - **Left**: Textures are moderately detailed and distinguishable.
   - **Right**: Textures appear muddled and less coherent.
   - **The left one is better.**

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**:
   - **Left**: Geometry exhibits some fine details, fitting better overall.
   - **Right**: Geometry looks less organized, with irregular shapes.
   - **The left one is better.**

6. **Overall**:
   - The left model most effectively captures and aligns all desired attributes, both visually and texturally.
   - **The left one is better.**

**Final answer:**
