Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has a more realistic and detailed design, capturing the essence of a traditional square coffee table.
   - The right model has a simpler design, but may lack finer details.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model appears solid and plausible with realistic proportions and detailed legs.
   - The right model, while less detailed, maintains a clear structure, but lacks intricacy.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left model has textures that adhere closely to its intricate geometry.
   - The right model has more generic textures and lacks alignment precision.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model captures fine details and textures without appearing blurry.
   - The right model's textures are relatively plain and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left model shows more intricacy and attention to the detailing of the legs.
   - The right model is simpler but lacks the richer geometry details found in the left.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the above criteria:
   - The left model more accurately fulfills the prompt and offers superior details and alignment in geometry and texture.
   - The left one is better.
