Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one more clearly reflects "a spherical doorknob" with a distinct sphere and base. The right one appears more as a general sphere without a clear doorknob feature.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural with a clear doorknob structure. The right one lacks the typical proportions of a doorknob.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures align well with the geometry, resembling a real doorknob. The right one lacks this clear alignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one exhibits more realistic textures suggesting a metallic surface. The right one appears to have less detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays smoother and more cohesive geometry details, particularly in the doorknob base. The right one is less detailed and organized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one represents the prompt more accurately with better structure and detail.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
