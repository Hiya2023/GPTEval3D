Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears to resemble a cubic ottoman with clean lines and simple design; the right one has a less clear cubic shape due to the vibrant and complex texture. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has more natural proportions and smoothness; the right one looks less solid due to its irregular texture and form.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns with the cubic geometry consistently; the right one's texture appears chaotic and doesn't match the geometry well.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures minimalistic details fitting an ottoman, while the right one's texture is too busy and abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left normal map is simple yet effective, showcasing the intended box shape. The right one lacks clear detail due to noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model better represents a cubic ottoman.
The left one is better.
