Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object exhibits additional rings and complexity that aren't mentioned in the text prompt, which is "A spherical doorknob." The right object accurately reflects a spherical shape without unnecessary details. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has additional elements that compromise its simplicity as a doorknob. The right object appears more streamlined and natural as a doorknob. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows inconsistencies between the geometry and texture. The right object's geometry and texture are more cohesive and spherical. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has more distracting surface details that aren't needed for a spherical doorknob. The right object maintains smoothness and appropriate detailing. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object features unnecessary complexity. The right object has a clear and functional structure. The right one is better.

6. Overall: Given the alignment with prompt, plausibility, and cohesion of details, the right object is better overall.
