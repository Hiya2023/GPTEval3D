Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one features a hexagonal shape, aligning well with the "hexagonal mirror" aspect. However, it lacks any visible triangular frame.
   - The right one has a triangular frame, aligning with the text prompt, but does not appear hexagonal.
   - The right one is better at capturing the frame aspect.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and plausible. The hexagonal shape is consistent and coherent in structure.
   - The right one has a less solid appearance and may have implausible or inconsistent areas.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a texture that seems smoother and less detailed.
   - The right one shows more texture details and sharper features.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
