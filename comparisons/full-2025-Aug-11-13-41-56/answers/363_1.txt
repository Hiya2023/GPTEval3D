Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a vibrant floral pattern with a noticeable protruding element, and it appears less round and more irregular in shape.
   - The right one has a simple but clear pattern and maintains a consistent round shape, aligning more closely with "a round cushion."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears less stable, with protrusions that might affect its solidity as a cushion.
   - The right model looks more solid and normal as a cushion, with a plausible round shape and uniform surface.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharp, detailed floral patterns, making the texture rich and colorful.
   - The right one has a simpler pattern, but it is less detailed compared to the left.
   - The left one is better.
