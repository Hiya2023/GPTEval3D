Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has ornate, non-square elements that do not fully represent a simple square coffee table.
   - The right one has a straightforward, square top and straight legs that fit the description accurately.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has complex, uneven shapes that might look less structurally solid.
   - The right one has a more consistent and robust appearance with cleaner lines.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows misalignment with inconsistent textures over complex shapes.
   - The right one has textures that align well with the simpler geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one appears to have more detailed textures, but they are not clear or fitting.
   - The right one captures uniform texture details that fit the model.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one's geometry is complex but not cleanly detailed.
   - The right one has simpler yet cleaner geometry fitting a square table.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment, plausibility, and detail quality:
   - The right one is better.
