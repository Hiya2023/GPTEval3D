Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) appears to have multiple tiers which might not be explicitly triangular, and the edges do not seem round. Instead, it's more of a complex, multi-layered structure.
   - The right one (object 2) clearly presents a triangular shape with round edges, aligning well with the text description of "A triangular shelf with round edges."

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
