Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a circular shape but lacks evidence of a cuboid bookshelf. The circular form resembles a clock but is not positioned above any identifiable bookshelf.
   - The right one displays more intricate textures and patterns, suggesting complexity, but it doesn't convincingly depict either a clock or a bookshelf.
   - Both lack clear depiction of the full prompt elements (a clock above a cuboid bookshelf), but the left object at least resembles part of the description.

The left one is better.

Final answer:
1
