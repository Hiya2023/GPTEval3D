Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to have a more abstract and colorful design, with a more ambiguous differentiation between stool and sofa, both with a uniform pattern.
   - The right model clearly demonstrates a round stool and a rectangular sofa, aligning more closely with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has an irregular shape that could cause confusion about its structural integrity and design intent. 
   - The right model features a more typical and structurally plausible form for both the stool and sofa.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a very vivid and abstract pattern that lacks realistic detail.
   - The right model shows more realistic textures with visible details, lines, and shading.
   - The right one is better.
