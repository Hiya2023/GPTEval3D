Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object resembles a triangular shelf but its edges are less rounded.
   - The right object also looks like a triangular shelf, but the edges appear slightly more rounded.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears less structured, with some irregularities.
   - The right object looks more solid and natural in shape and structure.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture is not well-aligned with its geometry.
   - The right object shows better alignment between texture and geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has smoother textures but lacks fine details.
   - The right object captures more detailed textures effectively.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object lacks intricate geometry details.
   - The right object has more detailed and clear geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right object consistently performs better across all criteria.
   The right one is better.
