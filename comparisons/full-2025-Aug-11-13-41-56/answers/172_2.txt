Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one features ornate legs and a non-square top, not fully matching "a square coffee table."
   - The right one is more straightforward and matches the description of a square coffee table.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has intricate details but seems less structurally solid.
   - The right one looks more stable and plausible as a piece of furniture.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has mismatched elaborate textures on its geometry.
   - The right one shows better alignment between texture and shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has detailed textures but seems overly stylized.
   - The right one maintains clear textures that are simple and appropriate.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has detailed but perhaps unnecessary complex geometry.
   - The right one has simple, efficient geometry that fits its purpose.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one better fulfills the criteria of alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometry detail efficiency.
   - The right one is better.
