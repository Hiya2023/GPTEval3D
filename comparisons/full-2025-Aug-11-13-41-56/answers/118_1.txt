Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object appears more circular in the RGB images, aligning better with the "circular rug" description. 
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object seems more natural with even surfaces in the normal images.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object shows a more consistent texture alignment with the geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left object has more detailed and coherent textures.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left object shows clearer and more refined geometry details.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object exhibits better alignment, plausibility, texture details, and geometry.
   - The left one is better.
