Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object accurately represents a square coffee table with a clear square shape and defined legs.
   - The right object has a square shape but exhibits uneven leg structures.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears more solid and natural with proper proportions.
   - The right object shows distorted and irregular structures.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object's texture aligns well with its geometry.
   - The right object shows misaligned textures with geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures fine details more effectively and has less blurriness.
   - The right object has less clarity in texture details.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object shows more detailed and coherent geometry.
   - The right object has distorted geometrical structures.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the left object consistently outperforms the right.
   - The left one is better.
