Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more distinct hexagonal shape in its design, which aligns better with the term "hexagonal."
   - The right one lacks a clear hexagonal form.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one maintains a consistent structure in line with a mirror's plausible design. 
   - The right one appears fragmented and less cohesive as a single object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a textured surface that resembles a reflective mirror with more clarity.
   - The right one has more natural surface reflections but lacks sharpness.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
