Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a spherical shape which aligns with the prompt “spherical doorknob”.
   - The right one has a more ornate design with additional details less resembling a simple sphere.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more solid and plausible as a doorknob with its simple, smooth structure.
   - The right one has more complex features which could lead to practical issues in a doorknob.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a shinier and more reflective texture, but less detail.
   - The right one has more detailed textures, appearing more realistic in terms of material.
   - The right one is better.
