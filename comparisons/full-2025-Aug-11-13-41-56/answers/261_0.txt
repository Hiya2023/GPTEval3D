Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) features a hexagonal tabletop with detailed textures and appears to have a central support. However, it lacks a visible round mirror above it.
   - The right one (object 2) has a more simplistic design with a distinctly hexagonal table visible, and a clear round mirror above it.

The right one is better due to the presence of both the hexagonal table and the round mirror as described in the prompt.

Final answer:
2
