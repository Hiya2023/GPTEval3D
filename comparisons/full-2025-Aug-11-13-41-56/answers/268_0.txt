Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (object 1) shows a rectangular sofa with details visible in the multi-view images. However, there's no visible oval mirror.
   - The right object (object 2) clearly depicts a rectangular sofa. Again, an oval mirror is not visible.

Both objects capture the "rectangular sofa" part of the prompt well. However, neither object includes the "oval mirror" from the prompt.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
