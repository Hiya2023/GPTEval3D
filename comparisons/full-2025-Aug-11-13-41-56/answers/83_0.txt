Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one accurately depicts a globe with detailed textures and a sophisticated base, aligning well with the "spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - The right one shows a globe but lacks a clear cubic pedestal structure.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has consistent proportions and appears realistic with its detailed features.
   - The right one lacks distinct features and seems more abstract.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left oneâ€™s textures align well with its 3D structure, especially on the globe.
   - The right one's texture and geometry are less aligned, particularly at the base.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one presents sharp, vibrant textures with clear continent details on the globe.
   - The right one is more blurred and lacks fine details.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one shows intricate structure details, especially at the base.
   - The right one has less defined structures.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria the left model is more accurate, plausible, and detailed.
   - The left one is better.
