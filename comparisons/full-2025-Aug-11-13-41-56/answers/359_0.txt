Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a more ornate design, with intricate legs and edges, which doesn’t fully align with the simplicity implied by “a square coffee table.” 
   - The right model more accurately represents a plain, square coffee table.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model, though detailed, appears less structurally plausible due to over-embellished elements.
   - The right model appears solid and realistic as a table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model has a more defined texture with visible details in the carvings.
   - The right model has smoother but less detailed textures.
   - The left one is better.
