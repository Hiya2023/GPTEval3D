Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a hexagonal shape noticeable within a triangular frame, while the right object also presents the described attributes but with less distinction in the triangular frame. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has more realistic proportions and structure, while the right one looks flatter and less solid. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows better alignment between textures and geometry, with clearer edges and structure. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has more defined textures, while the right one appears flat and blurry. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object displays more intricate detailing in geometry, whereas the right one lacks these details. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object convincingly captures all evaluated criteria and is more aligned with the original text prompt. The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
