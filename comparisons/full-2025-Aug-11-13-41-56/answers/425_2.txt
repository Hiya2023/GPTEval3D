Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears as a multicolored rectangular sofa with clearly defined cylindrical armrests, corresponding well to the prompt.
   - The right one also displays a sofa with noticeable arms but seems bulkier and less rectangular.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks consistent and solid with a clear structure shown from different angles.
   - The right one seems less structured, with the normals indicating possible irregularities.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper textures with clearer color patterns, adding detail.
   - The right one is more uniform in color, lacking distinct textures.
   - The left one is better.
