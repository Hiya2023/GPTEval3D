Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one has a circular top and base, but the base isn't square as the prompt describes.
   - The right one also has a circular top and base, but similarly lacks a square base.
   - Cannot decide which is better as neither aligns completely with the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and plausible, with smooth and consistent geometry.
   - The right one seems less refined, with possible irregularities in the texture giving it an unrealistic appearance.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother texture but lacks detail.
   - The right one, despite looking rougher, has more apparent texture details.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
