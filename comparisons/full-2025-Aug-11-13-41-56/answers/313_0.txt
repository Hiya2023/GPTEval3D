Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model resembles a traditional lamp with a curved base, but it does not appear cubic.
   - The right model appears more cubic with a distinct cubical top but also has a curved base.
   - The right one is better in terms of alignment with "a cubic lamp with a curved base."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks like a typical lamp and seems structurally sound.
   - The right model has a more abstract form with visible noise and less coherent structure.
   - The left one is better regarding plausibility and coherence.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a clearer, more polished texture that is consistent with real-world materials.
   - The right model's texture appears noisy and less detailed.
   - The left one is better for texture quality.

Final answer:
