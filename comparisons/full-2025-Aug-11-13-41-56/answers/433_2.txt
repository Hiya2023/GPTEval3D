Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: The model consists of a round tabletop supported by a central pedestal with intricately designed legs. It doesn't clearly represent an oval shape.
   - The right one: This model has an oval tabletop with four legs, aligning well with the "oval dining table" description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Appears structurally sound and normal, though the central pedestal could be less common for dining tables.
   - The right one: Looks solid and plausible as a dining table with four legs, which are typical for stability.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: The texture is detailed, capturing wood grain nicely.
   - The right one: The texture is also detailed but slightly sharper, especially on the tabletop.
   - The right one is better.
