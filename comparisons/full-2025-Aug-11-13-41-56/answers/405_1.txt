Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one appears to be a traditional lamp, with a notable curved base. The design corresponds to a lamp but lacks clear cubic elements.
   - The right one looks more abstract, with a cubical form as part of its design, aligning better with the "cubic" attribute but not clearly being a lamp.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more like a traditional and solid lamp with a plausible structure.
   - The right model appears abstract, with potential noise and irregularities, making it less solid and recognizable.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows finer details and a more realistic lamp texture.
   - The right model's texture appears noisier and less sharp.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
