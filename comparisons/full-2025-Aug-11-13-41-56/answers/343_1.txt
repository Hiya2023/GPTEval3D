Sure, hereâ€™s the analysis based on your criteria:

Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a simple spherical shape which aligns with the prompt "A spherical doorknob". It is straightforward and fits the description well.
   - The right object, while intricate and detailed, deviates from a pure spherical shape. It includes ornate patterns that are not mentioned in the prompt.
   
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears simple and smooth but lacks some detail, making it fairly plausible as a doorknob.
   - The right object, despite its complex design, appears solid and complete. Its detailed structure seems coherent and plausible as a 3D object.
   
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object, although smooth, has less detailed texture, making it appear somewhat flat.
   - The right object shows a high level of texture detail, with intricate patterns and realistic shading.
   
   The right one is better.
