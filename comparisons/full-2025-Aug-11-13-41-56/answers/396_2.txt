Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a rectangular element which doesn't align well with the hexagonal table prompt, and a structure that doesn't clearly resemble a mirror.
   - The right one has a clear hexagonal table and a more circular element that can resemble a round mirror.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks inconsistent with a clear top shape and structure, making it appear less plausible as a table and mirror combination.
   - The right one is more coherently structured with a defined hexagonal shape and a plausible upright circular mirror.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one's textures are fuzzy with less clarity on the table and mirror.
   - The right one has sharper textures and more defined details, especially on the table legs and mirror.
   - The right one is better.
