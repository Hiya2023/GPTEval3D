I'm unable to view images or visual details, but I can guide you on how to conduct a comparison based on your observations:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Check if the object reflects a "hexagonal table under a round mirror". Note the shapes and alignment.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Do the same check for hexagonal table and round mirror alignment.
   - Decide which object better represents the text prompt attributes.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate if the 3D structure looks normal and solid. Look for any strange shapes or asymmetries.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Similarly evaluate for solidness and absence of anomalies.
   - Decide which is more plausible based on structure integrity and absence of noise.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Focus on texture sharpness and detail clarity.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Check for realism and detailed textures.
   - Choose which has the superior texture quality.

### Final Answer:
Provide your decisions for each aspect in the format "x x x" based on your assessments.
