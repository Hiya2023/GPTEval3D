Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model features a colorful, patchwork design and appears more rounded, which somewhat deviates from a cubic shape.
   - The right model is more cubic and simple, aligning more closely with the prompt "A cubic ottoman."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks more solid with a clear texture and structural form.
   - The right model appears rough and less detailed, affecting its plausibility.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a vivid and detailed texture due to its patchwork design.
   - The right model has a plain and less defined texture.
   - The left one is better.
