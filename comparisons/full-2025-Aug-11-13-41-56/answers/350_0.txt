Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be an elliptical coffee table with circular legs, though details are less clear in texture.
   - The right model clearly shows an elliptical table with circular legs and has distinct details.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears somewhat flat and lacks depth, making it less solid in appearance.
   - The right model appears more three-dimensional, solid, and has a normal structural layout.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture is somewhat blurred and lacks detail.
   - The right model exhibits sharper, more realistic textures with more detail.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
