Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to represent a table with a hexagonal shape and a reflective surface, which somewhat aligns with the idea of being under a round mirror. However, the mirror aspect isn't distinctly visible.
   - The right object also shows a hexagonal shape and reflective surfaces but lacks clear representation of a round mirror.
   - Overall, both objects partially represent the text prompt but neither fully captures the concept of a table under a mirror specifically.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks more coherent with its supports and a defined reflective top, making it plausible as a solid object.
   - The right object seems less structurally plausible given its less distinct form and lack of visible support for a table.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object shows more detailed textures with distinct patterns and reflections, and the surface details are more visible.
   - The right object has less sharp and detailed textures compared to the left.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
3 1 1
