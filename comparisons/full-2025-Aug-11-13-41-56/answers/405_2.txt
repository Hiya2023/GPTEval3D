Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a lamp with a visible base and shade, but it's more traditional rather than cubic.
   - The right one is a cubic shape with a curved surface but lacks features of a lamp.
   - The right one better covers the "cubic" aspect, while the left one aligns more with a typical lamp structure.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a plausible structure for a lamp, with a clear base and shade.
   - The right one appears abstract and not entirely plausible as a lamp.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother and more realistic texture that resembles a real lamp.
   - The right one has a more abstract and less detailed texture.
   - The left one is better.
