Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (object 1) is more detailed and features a patterned design, which adds complexity beyond the simple prompt of "a round cushion." It doesn't align strictly with the simplicity implied by the prompt.
   - The right object (object 2) is a plain, simple round cushion adhering more closely to the simplicity described in the text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
