Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has a round shape, but lacks a clear stool next to a rectangular sofa.
   - The right model accurately displays a rectangular sofa with a round stool beside it.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more rounded but less defined as furniture.
   - The right model has a clear sofa and stool, showing realistic furniture proportions.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's textures do not clearly define distinct furniture items.
   - The right model has textures that closely follow the sofa and stool geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model's textures are less detailed and somewhat blurry.
   - The right model presents finer texture details, especially on the sofa.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model lacks intricate details and appears smooth but undefined.
   - The right model has more detailed surface structures visible in the normal maps.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering the criteria above, the right model clearly aligns better with the prompt and shows superior detail and realism.
   The right one is better.
