Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a noticeable cubic shape, which fits well with "A cubic ottoman." The right model also shows a cubic form but less distinctively. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more solid and realistic, with a believable cubic structure. The right model looks less natural with some irregularities. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its cubic shape, showing consistency in both RGB and normal maps. The right model's texture and geometry are less aligned. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's texture captures fine details and maintains clarity, while the right model shows some blurriness and inconsistency. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has well-defined geometry details that are smooth and organized. The right model exhibits more noise and less definition. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model consistently shows superiority in all evaluated criteria. The left one is better.
