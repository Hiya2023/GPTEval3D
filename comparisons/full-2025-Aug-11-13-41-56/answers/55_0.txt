Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has shelves but doesn't resemble a triangular form. The right object is a triangular shape with distinct round edges. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model does not exhibit a plausible shelf-like structure. The right one has a more realistic triangular shelf appearance with round edges. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture does not align well with its geometry. The right object's texture matches its triangular geometric form. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has less defined textures. The right one has more detailed textures that enhance the shape. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's geometry lacks intricacy. The right model shows more detailed geometric features, particularly around the edges. The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model is more aligned with the prompt, plausible, and detailed. The right one is better.
