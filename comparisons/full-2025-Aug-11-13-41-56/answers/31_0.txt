Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object does not clearly resemble a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests, while the right one more closely aligns with these features, including evident armrests. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears less solid and coherent, while the right object shows a more natural and plausible shape, with clear sofa-like features and structures.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows inconsistency between texture and shape, whereas the right object's textures align better with its geometry, reflecting a cohesive structure.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object lacks detailed textures and appears blurry; the right object displays more distinct and clear textures throughout.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has unclear geometry details, while the right object exhibits more intricate and organized shapes that align with the expected features of a sofa.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object meets the criteria better by presenting a clear, well-aligned, and detailed 3D model.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
