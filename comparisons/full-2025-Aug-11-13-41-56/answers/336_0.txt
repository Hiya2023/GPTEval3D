Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a clear cubic shape with a distinguishable curved base, corresponding well to the text prompt "A cubic lamp with a curved base."
   - The right model lacks a clear cubic shape or any recognizable lamp characteristics.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks solid and coherent, with a clear lamp-like structure.
   - The right model appears noisy and lacks clear structure and solidity.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has defined textures that resemble a lamp, with visible details.
   - The right modelâ€™s textures are blurry and lack detail.
   - The left one is better.
