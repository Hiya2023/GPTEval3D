Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a circular seat but lacks a clear square base, as the base seems more circular.
   - The right one also has a circular seat but similarly features a circular base.
   - Neither fully aligns with the "square base" component of the text prompt. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks more complex but has potential artifacts and less plausible structure where the base and seat connect.
   - The right model appears simpler and cleaner with more plausible connections between the parts.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows more texture detail and sharpness in the rendering, with varied colors.
   - The right model, while smoother, lacks sharp texture detail compared to the left.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
