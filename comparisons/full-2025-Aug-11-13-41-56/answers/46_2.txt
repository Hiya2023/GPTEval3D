Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one poorly matches the text prompt; the right one clearly depicts a spherical chair with a flat seat. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears fragmented and lacks coherence; the right model is more natural and solid.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures don't align well with its geometry; the right model has cohesive textures and shapes.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model is blurry and lacks detail; the right model exhibits more refined and clear textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's geometry is disorganized; the right model shows well-defined and smooth geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model excels in all aspects, including alignment with the text, plausibility, and detail.
The right one is better.
