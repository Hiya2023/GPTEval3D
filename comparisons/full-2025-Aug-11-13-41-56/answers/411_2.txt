Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one has a more defined cubic shape but lacks a clear curved base.
   - The right one resembles a cube with a discernible base that appears curved.
   - The right one is better in terms of alignment with the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and well-defined, though it's more of a ring than a cube.
   - The right one is less visually coherent and seems to have noise or incomplete features.
   - The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper and more detailed textures with visible patterns.
   - The right one appears to have a more grainy and less detailed surface.
   - The left one is better in terms of low-level texture.

Final answer:
