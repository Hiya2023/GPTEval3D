Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - **Left (object 1):** Resembles a lamp with a curved base but has a round lamp shade, not cubic.
   - **Right (object 2):** Appears more cubic but lacks a clear curved base.
   - **Decision:** Left (object 1) is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (object 1):** More solid and coherent as a lamp model, though the shade shape is off.
   - **Right (object 2):** Has irregular and noisy structures, lacking solid form.
   - **Decision:** Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (object 1):** Shows sharper and more detailed textures, resembling a lamp.
   - **Right (object 2):** Textures are noisy and less defined.
   - **Decision:** Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
