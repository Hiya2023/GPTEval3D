Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is not triangular; it appears to be more rectangular and does not accurately represent the prompt "triangular road sign."
   - The right one better represents a triangular shape, aligning well with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems to have a solid structure but is not plausible as a triangular road sign due to its non-triangular shape.
   - The right one has a logical triangular shape and appears more plausible as a road sign.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed textures indicating signs of wear and text, which adds realism.
   - The right one also has a textured appearance but is less detailed than the left.
   - The left one is better.
