Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object features a floral pattern on a conical shape but lacks a clear cylindrical base.
   - The right object has a conical lampshade and a distinct cylindrical base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears less structured, potentially having unclear boundary definitions.
   - The right object looks more solid and structurally plausible as a lamp with a clear base and shade.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more detailed and sharp floral textures.
   - The right objectâ€™s texture is less detailed compared to the left.
   - The left one is better.
