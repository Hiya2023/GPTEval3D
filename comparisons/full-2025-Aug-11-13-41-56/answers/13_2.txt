Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one accurately represents a simple rectangular bookshelf as described in the prompt. The right one appears to include additional objects not mentioned. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a stable structure with plausible proportions. The right one includes irregularities, such as extraneous objects. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has aligned textures and geometry, with consistent appearance across views. The right one shows misalignment and inconsistent texture application. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures fine details without being blurry. The right one appears noisy and lacks fine detail coherence. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one maintains smooth and well-organized geometry. The right one has more noise and irregularities. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one consistently meets the criteria better across all aspects. The left one is better.
