Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model appears closer to a cubic shape with a simplistic design that aligns more with the "cubic ottoman" description. The right model features more detailed patterns and textures but deviates from a pure cubic form. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: Both models seem solid and plausible as ottomans. However, the right model has more realistic detailing that adds to its natural appearance.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture is simple and aligns well with its shape. The right model has more complex textures that partially align with the geometry though there are some mismatches.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right model captures intricate patterns and details, whereas the left model's texture is plain and lacks detail.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has clean and straightforward geometry, but the right model exhibits more detailed geometry that enhances the intricate design.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: Considering the balance between shape, texture, and detail, the right one provides a richer 3D depiction even though it's less cubic. However, the left one aligns more with the prompt's simplicity.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
