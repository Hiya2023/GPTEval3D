Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear rectangular form with cylindrical armrests, closely matching the text prompt.
   - The right one also has a rectangular shape and cylindrical armrests but is less defined in shape.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more solid, with well-defined structures and no unusual characteristics.
   - The right one has some indistinct features and less solidity.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a more detailed texture with sharper and more realistic elements.
   - The right one appears more blurred and lacks detail.
   The left one is better.
