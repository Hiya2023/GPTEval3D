Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object appears less defined and lacks clarity. The right object distinctly shows a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests, closely matching the description.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object seems less solid and lacks clear structure. The right object appears more natural and solid, with better-defined shapes and structures.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows poor alignment between geometry and texture. The right object displays good alignment, with textures corresponding well to the sofa's shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object lacks texture detail and appears blurry. The right object has clear and detailed textures that align with the sofa aesthetic.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object lacks intricate geometry detail and structure. The right object displays organized and well-defined geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right object excels in all criteria, providing a more accurate and detailed representation of the prompt.
The right one is better.
