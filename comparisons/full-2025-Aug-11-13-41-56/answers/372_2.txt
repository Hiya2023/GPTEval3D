Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a cube-shaped lamp with a clear cubic design and a flat base.
   - The right one is a lamp with a rounded shape and a curved base.
   - Given the prompt "A cubic lamp with a curved base," the left one better represents the cubic aspect, but the right one better represents the curved base.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and consistently structured, with a plausible cube shape.
   - The right one also looks plausible as a lamp but lacks clear cubic features.
   - Given the prompt, both have strengths, but the left feels more traditional and complete in its construction.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharp edges, but the texture may seem simple or less detailed.
   - The right one shows more detailed texture, especially with the color gradient, giving it a more realistic appearance.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
