Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one clearly shows a round stool beside a rectangular sofa; the right one has poor representation with distorted objects.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks more natural with solid and recognizable structures; the right model has notable deformations and seems unrealistic.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its geometry; the right model has misalignment issues and fragmented structures.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clear textures that depict the intended objects; the right modelâ€™s textures are unclear and muddy.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows detailed and coherent geometry; the right model has disorganized and noisy details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model consistently outperforms the right in all aspects evaluated.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
