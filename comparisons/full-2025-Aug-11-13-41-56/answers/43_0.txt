Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one captures a clearer rectangular shape and cylindrical armrests.
   - The right one is less distinct, making it harder to identify features.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and structured.
   - The right one has indistinct features and looks flatter.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has textures that align well with the sofaâ€™s shape and structure.
   - The right one lacks clarity in texture alignment.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has more detailed and clear textures.
   - The right one appears blurry and less defined.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows organized and smooth geometry.
   - The right one lacks intricate detail and is less visually pleasing.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model effectively captures the prompt, appears plausible and well-detailed.
   The left one is better.
