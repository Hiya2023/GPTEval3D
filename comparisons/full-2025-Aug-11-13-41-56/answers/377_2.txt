Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a spherical shape, but the globe appears fragmented and the pedestal is not clearly cubic.
   - The right one is clearly a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears fragmented with parts not connected properly, making it implausible.
   - The right one is more solid and coherent, with a clear structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has some detailed textures but is inconsistent and lacks cohesion.
   - The right one has a simpler texture that is more uniform and realistic.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
