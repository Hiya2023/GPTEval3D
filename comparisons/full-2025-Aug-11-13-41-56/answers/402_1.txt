Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more circular appearance rather than oval and features a single central pedestal with multiple legs.
   - The right one resembles an oval shape more closely and has four legs at the corners.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have an unclear base with a possibly unstable structure.
   - The right one looks more like a traditional table with a clearer leg structure and stability.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a blurred and less detailed texture, especially around the base and legs.
   - The right one shows sharper and more defined textures, with visible wood grain on the surface.
   - The right one is better.
