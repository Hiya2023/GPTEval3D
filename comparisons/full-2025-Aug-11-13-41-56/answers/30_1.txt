   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - **Left**: Textures are colorful but lack clarity.
   - **Right**: Textures are more consistent and fit the object well.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - **Left**: Shows some irregularities; details are lacking.
   - **Right**: Smoother and more organized.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right one is more accurate and detailed.
