Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a wider shape, not precisely cylindrical; the right object is more cylindrical as described. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has a more realistic vase shape, while the right one has a plausible cylindrical form; both have reasonable solidity. Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture does not match the cylindrical geometry; the right object's texture aligns with its cylindrical geometry. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object shows more detailed texture, while the right one is somewhat blurry. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object appears to have more intricate geometric details, while the right object is simpler but smoother. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better meets the cylindrical prompt, but the left one displays better details. Cannot decide.

Final answer:
2 3 2 1 1 3
