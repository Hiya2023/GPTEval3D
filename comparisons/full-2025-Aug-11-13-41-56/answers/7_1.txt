Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model depicts a red cone with no visible ball. The right model shows an orange cone with a ball beside it, closely matching the text prompt "A triangular traffic cone beside a circular ball."
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model lacks a ball and has floating elements, while the right model appears more natural and complete with correct object alignment.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture appears disconnected from the geometry. The right model's textures align more accurately, especially with the ball.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are blurry and lack detail. The right model exhibits more vibrant and detailed textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's geometry appears less defined, with possible noise. The right model has more refined and organized geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model consistently aligns better with the prompt, 3D plausibility, and detail considerations.
The right one is better.
