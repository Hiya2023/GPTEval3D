Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a colorful pattern and a shape not typical of a round cushion. It looks more like a vibrant, flower-like object.
   - The right one more closely resembles a round cushion with a simple structure and woolly texture.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one's structure seems irregular and not solid for a cushion; it has elaborate and complex forms.
   - The right one is simple, solid, and has the typical form of a round cushion.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a detailed, bright, and complex texture, though perhaps not fitting for a cushion.
   - The right one has a consistent, realistic texture for a fabric cushion.
   - The right one is better.
