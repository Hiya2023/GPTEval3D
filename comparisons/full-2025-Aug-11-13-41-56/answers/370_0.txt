Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a more detailed ornate design, which may deviate from a simple square coffee table concept due to its intricate features.
   - The right one has a simpler and more straightforward square shape, aligning better with the basic description of "a square coffee table."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one, despite being detailed, seems plausible and structurally sound with clear leg formation.
   - The right one also looks plausible as a solid table structure but has less visible detail.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows more texture detail with clearer patterns on the surface.
   - The right one seems to have a more muted and less distinct texture.
   - The left one is better.
