Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has an elliptical shape but the legs are not circular as described.
   - The right one maintains an elliptical top with circular legs, closely matching the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears less solid, with legs that might not realistically support the table.
   - The right one looks more robust, with well-structured legs and overall plausible form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows a texture that is more consistent and detailed.
   - The right one has noticeable texture inconsistencies and less sharpness.
   - The left one is better.
