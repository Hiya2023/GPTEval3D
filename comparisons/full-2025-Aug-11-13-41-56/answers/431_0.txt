Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is an oval table with simple, straight legs suggesting a more minimal design.
   - The right one is also oval but has a more ornate base with curved legs.
   - Both align with the “oval dining table” prompt, but the left one captures the simplicity better.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and simple, with a straightforward design.
   - The right one has more complex and ornate features, which are well-formed and plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more uniform texture but lacks detail.
   - The right one has a richer, more detailed texture that looks more realistic.
   - The right one is better.
