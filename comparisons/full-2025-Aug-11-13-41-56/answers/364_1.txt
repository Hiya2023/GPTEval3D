Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object looks like a cubic shape with a soft surface and visible legs, aligning well with the text prompt "A cubic ottoman."
   - The right object is less clear in its features due to darker rendering but seems more rounded and less cubic.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears consistent with a plausible ottoman shape, though the textures are a bit soft.
   - The right object seems less coherent, with odd shadowing and less defined structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a visibly smoother texture and less defined detail.
   - The right object, although dark, has sharp detailing in certain areas.
   - The right one is better.
