Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a rectangular sofa but lacks a clear round stool beside it.
   - The right one includes both a rectangular sofa and a small, round-like object that resembles a stool.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is somewhat consistent in structure but lacks the additional item.
   - The right one looks more complete with two distinct objects, though the stool could be more round.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more consistent and clearer texture.
   - The right one has less detail and appears slightly blurry.
   - The left one is better.
