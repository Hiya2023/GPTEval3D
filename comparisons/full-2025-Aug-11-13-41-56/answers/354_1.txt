Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a trapezoidal structure, with asymmetrical sides and horizontal shelves that align well with the trapezoidal description.
   - The right one has an A-frame structure, more resembling a triangular shape, which does not align as well with the trapezoidal prompt.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid and has well-defined, consistent geometry without strange or duplicated parts.
   - The right one has a plausible A-frame bookshelf structure, but the texture may affect its solidity.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper textures with more defined wood-like detail.
   - The right one has a more muted, less detailed texture which appears blurred.
   The left one is better.
