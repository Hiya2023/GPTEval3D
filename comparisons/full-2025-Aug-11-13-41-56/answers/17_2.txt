Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object appears more like a triangular road sign, fulfilling the text prompt directly.
   - The right object is more diamond-shaped and less aligned with the "triangular" description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object has a reasonably plausible structure for a road sign with appropriate proportions.
   - The right object looks distorted and less natural for a road sign.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object shows a clearer and more consistent alignment between the geometry and texture.
   - The right object appears misaligned with textures not properly mapping to geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object shows clearer details and better textures without blurring.
   - The right object appears more abstract and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has more distinct and well-defined geometry.
   - The right object has irregularities and less detailed geometry.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left object consistently performs better across all criteria.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
