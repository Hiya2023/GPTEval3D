Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to be a spherical shape on a cubic pedestal, matching the description well.
   - The right model has a spherical globe with more detailed mapping but lacks a clear cubic pedestal.
   - The left one is better for aligning with the full text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks solid and plausible, with no obvious distorted structures.
   - The right model has detailed textures but the structure appears less cohesive and potentially has noise.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has smoother textures but lacks detail and sharpness.
   - The right model has sharper, more detailed textures, making it appear more realistic.
   - The right one is better.
