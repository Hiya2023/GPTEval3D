Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clearer cubic shape with distinct edges, aligning well with the prompt "a cubic ottoman."
   - The right one appears less distinctly cubic and more rounded, not fully capturing "cubic."
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows well-defined structure and legs, looking solid and plausible.
   - The right one also seems solid, but its roundness may suggest less conventional structure for a cubic ottoman.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a sharp, detailed, and colorful texture that stands out.
   - The right one has a similarly detailed texture, but slightly less vibrant.
   - The left one is better.
