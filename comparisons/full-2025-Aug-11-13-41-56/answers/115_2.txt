Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is rectangular and doesnâ€™t fit the circular description; The right one is circular. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has sharp edges suggesting it lacks plausibility for softness; The right one appears more naturally circular and plausible as a rug.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows a mismatch in shape and texture; The right one has alignment between circular geometry and texture.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears less detailed; The right one has clear, distinct patterns.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks intricate geometry; The right one shows more detailed and complex geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one better represents the prompt and has more natural features.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
