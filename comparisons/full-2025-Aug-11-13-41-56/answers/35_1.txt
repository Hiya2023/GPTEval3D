Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a triangular shape but lacks shelves and rounded edges.
   - The right one has a proper shelf structure but lacks a clear triangular form.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more abstract and less plausible as a functional shelf.
   - The right one has a realistic shelving structure.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture does not match any shelving geometry.
   - The right one's texture aligns with the shelf geometry.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has abstract textures.
   - The right one shows clearer, more detailed textures.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one lacks clear geometric details.
   - The right one shows better defined shelf details.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria:
   - Right (object 2) captures more attributes from the prompt and exhibits better realism in texture and geometry.

Final answer:
