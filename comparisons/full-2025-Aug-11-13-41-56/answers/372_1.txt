Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object (Object 1) is a cubic shape with a distinct square form and a base that appears slightly curved or elevated. 
   - The right object (Object 2) looks more like a traditional lamp with a conical shade and a clearly curved base. 
   - The right one is better at fulfilling the text prompt "A cubic lamp with a curved base," as it better captures the curved base description while still incorporating cubic elements.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid with clear edges, but the structure's design seems less conventional for a lamp.
   - The right object appears more natural and plausible as a lamp, with a well-defined base and structure.
   - The right one is better in terms of 3D plausibility, appearing more conventional and cohesive.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has grainy textures, especially on the cubic part.
   - The right object has more defined textures, with variations on the shade and base that enhance realism.
   - The right one is better for low-level texture due to its sharper and more realistic detailing.

Final answer:
