Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left model appears more like a traditional rectangular shelf with sharp edges, which does not match the "triangular shelf with round edges" prompt.
   - The right model is distinctly triangular and appears to have rounder edges, aligning better with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left model looks structurally plausible as a shelf but doesn't match the triangular description. There are no obvious issues with parts or noise.
   - The right model seems structurally plausible as a triangular object, with no obvious distortions or duplications.
   - The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left object has some wooden texture which looks relatively detailed.
   - The right object has a consistent texture but appears slightly less realistic and defined.
   - The left one is better.
