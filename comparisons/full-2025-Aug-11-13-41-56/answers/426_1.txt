Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   The left model is complex with irregular textures and shapes, making it less clear if it aligns with the prompt of "a rectangular bookshelf". 
   The right model has a clearer rectangular structure, more closely resembling a typical bookshelf.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   The left model appears more abstract and irregular, with potential structural inconsistencies and overlaps.
   The right model looks more solid and plausible as a typical bookshelf, with straight lines and uniform shelves.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   The left model's texture is detailed but chaotic, with unclear elements.
   The right model's texture is simpler, but also clearer and more uniform, which is more fitting for a bookshelf.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
