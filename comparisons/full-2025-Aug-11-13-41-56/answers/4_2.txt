Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a rectangular sofa but lacks the mirror; the right object has a more decorative design that doesn't clearly show a mirror. 
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more solid and coherent; the right object has distorted features. 
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture aligns well with its geometry, whereas the right one shows mismatched elements. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The texture on the left is more detailed and realistic compared to the more chaotic texture on the right. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits more well-defined geometry details, while the right one appears noisy. 
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object better captures the intended design with more realistic and coherent features.
The left one is better.
