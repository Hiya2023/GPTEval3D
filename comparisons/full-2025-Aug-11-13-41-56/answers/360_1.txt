Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one is a round, patterned cushion with a clear cushion-like shape.
   - The right one has a more amorphous shape with unclear details.
   - The left one is better aligned with the prompt "A round cushion."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and distinct, resembling a plausible cushion.
   - The right one seems less structured and has a less clear, cushion-like form.
   - The left one is more plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed and crisp textures, with well-defined patterns.
   - The right one lacks texture detail and appears rough.
   - The left one has sharper and more realistic textures.
