Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a simple, rectangular shelf with clear horizontal divisions, aligning closely with a "rectangular bookshelf."
   - The right one contains additional elements and a more complex shape, making it less aligned with the simple description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more solid and stable with consistent proportions.
   - The right one has irregular shapes and extraneous elements, reducing its plausibility.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one shows consistent alignment between geometry and texture.
   - The right one has mismatches, with textures not adhering to the structure effectively.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one captures details clearly and consistently without blurring.
   - The right one appears noisier with less defined textures.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one has smoother, more organized geometry.
   - The right one exhibits noise and irregularities in geometric details.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall: 
   - Considering all aspects, the left one is consistently better aligned with the criteria.
   - The left one is better.
