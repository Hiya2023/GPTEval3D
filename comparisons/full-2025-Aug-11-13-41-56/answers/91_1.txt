Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a more pronounced triangular shape which aligns better with "A triangular road sign." The right model appears more diamond-shaped.  
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model seems more solid and realistic with fewer irregularities in proportions. The right has some uneven structures.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's textures and geometry are more closely aligned, particularly where the sign meets the post. The right one shows some misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer details, particularly on the surface texture of the sign, without being too blurry. The right is more abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model provides a more organized structure with smooth geometry in the normal maps. The right has some noise and irregularity.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model excels in text alignment, plausibility, alignment, and details.
The left one is better.
