Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to consist of two distinct pieces but does not clearly show a round stool and rectangular sofa.
   - The right model has a more defined shape potentially suggesting a sofa, but lacks a distinct round stool.
   - **Cannot decide.**

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks colorful and more solid but not clearly defined.
   - The right model appears more structured and realistic with clearer distinctions in parts.
   - **Right (object 2) is better.**

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has vibrant textures but they appear somewhat abstract and less realistic.
   - The right model has more defined textures that suggest a wooden or leather surface.
   - **Right (object 2) is better.**

Final answer:
