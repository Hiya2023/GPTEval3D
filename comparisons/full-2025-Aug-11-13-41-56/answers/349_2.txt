Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a more traditional round cushion with clear circular structure and recognizable cushion-like features. 
   - The right one appears more like a plant or object with a textured, leafy surface, which does not align with the simple idea of a "round cushion."
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have a clear, coherent shape consistent with a functional cushion, with no strange structures.
   - The right one seems irregular and less solid, with a surface texture that implies a non-cushion object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows a detailed and crisp texture with distinct patterns that suggest fabric or embroidery.
   - The right one has a more blended, less distinct texture that seems less detailed and realistic for the prompt.
   - The left one is better.
