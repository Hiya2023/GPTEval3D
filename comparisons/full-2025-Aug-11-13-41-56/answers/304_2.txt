Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one features irregular shapes and holes, which do not align well with the description of a "rectangular bookshelf." The shelves and structure appear chaotic.
   - The right one has a more classic rectangular shape with clearly defined shelves, closely matching the concept of a bookshelf.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears unstable with holes and unusual shapes that do not suggest a solid structure.
   - The right model is more structured and looks like a plausible bookshelf with appropriate dimensions.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a rough texture, with visible distortion and lack of detail.
   - The right one has a more consistent and sharper texture, although it may lack some refinement.
   - The right one is better.
