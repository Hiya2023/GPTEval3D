Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one is circular but lacks details; The right one is also circular and similar in complexity.
Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one looks plausible with no strange structures; The right one also appears plausible and maintains consistency.
Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture. The left one shows solid but basic texture; The right one has similar texture quality.
Cannot decide.

Final answer:
3 3 3
