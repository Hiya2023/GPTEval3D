Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a clear rectangular shape with cylindrical armrests, closely aligning with the text prompt.
   - The right object appears irregular and doesn't clearly reflect the attributes of a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and plausible as a 3D model of a sofa with expected form and structure.
   - The right object appears distorted and has unusual structural features that are not typical for a sofa.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object exhibits smoother and more coherent textures suitable for a sofa.
   - The right object's textures appear noisy and less realistic.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
