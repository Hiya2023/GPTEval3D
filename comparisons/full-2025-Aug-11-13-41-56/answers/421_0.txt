Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to be a damaged or worn triangular sign mounted on a rough pole. It doesn't clearly depict a typical road sign due to the irregular shape and additional features.
   - The right model more closely resembles a triangular road sign with a clearer triangular shape, consistent with the concept of a road sign.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model includes extra textures and anomalies, making it seem less solid and more irregular.
   - The right model looks more structurally plausible and solid as a distinct triangular sign.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has more visible texture detail with varied patterns and colors present.
   - The right model has more uniform texture but lacks intricate details on the triangle itself.
   - The left one is better.
