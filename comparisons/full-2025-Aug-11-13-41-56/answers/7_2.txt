Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one lacks a ball; the right one includes both a cone and a ball. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows cones only, with slightly distorted bases; the right one displays coherent structure and plausible proportions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left oneâ€™s texture alignment is less relevant due to missing object; the right one matches textures well, especially for separate objects.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one shows less detail; the right one has detailed features on both objects.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays basic shape; the right one shows better geometry detail on both the cone and the ball.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all factors, the right one includes all prompt elements and shows better execution in all other areas. 
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
