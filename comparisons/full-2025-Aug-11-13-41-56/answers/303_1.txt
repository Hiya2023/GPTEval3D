Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: Resembles a triangular shape, aligning well with the prompt "A triangular road sign."
   - The right one: Does not correspond to a triangular shape; it has a rectangular form.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one: Appears solid with a clear triangular form.
   - The right one: Has a more complex structure but lacks the specified triangular shape and looks less plausible as a "triangular" sign.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one: The texture is somewhat rough but distinct.
   - The right one: Appears to have more detailed textures with visible text.
   - The right one is better.
