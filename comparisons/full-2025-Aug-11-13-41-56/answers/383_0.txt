Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: The model is simple and spherical, closely matching the description of a "spherical doorknob."
   - The right one: The model is more complex, with additional ornate details and not purely spherical.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: The model is a basic sphere, solid and plausible, with no visible issues.
   - The right one: The model has intricate detailing, which may suggest excess complexity for a doorknob.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: The texture is basic and uniform without much detail.
   - The right one: The texture is more detailed and intricate, offering a realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.
