Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has an unusual shape with irregular, amorphous features which do not align well with the descriptor "rectangular bookshelf."
   - The right one clearly appears as a rectangular bookshelf with well-defined shelves and structure.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model appears irregular and lacks coherence in structure, making it less plausible as a solid object.
   - The right model appears more structured and appropriate for a typical bookshelf, with no glaring structural issues.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a texture that seems blurred and lacks detail.
   - The right one has sharper textures that resemble wood grain and a more coherent look overall.
   - The right one is better.
