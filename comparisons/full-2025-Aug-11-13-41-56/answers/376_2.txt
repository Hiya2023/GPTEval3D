Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a hexagonal mirror with some interior reflections, but lacks a clear triangular frame.
   - The right one has a more defined hexagonal shape, but also lacks a clear triangular frame.
   - Both fail to incorporate a triangular frame, but the left one shows a more convincing mirror effect. 

   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a solid hexagonal mirror, but there's no frame visible.
   - The right one looks less plausible with undefined structures and lacks any framing.
 
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one displays realistic reflections and textures in the mirror.
   - The right one shows inconsistent textures with no clear detailing.

   The left one is better.
