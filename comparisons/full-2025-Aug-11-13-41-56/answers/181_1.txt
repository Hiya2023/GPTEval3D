Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object lacks a cubic pedestal, focusing solely on the globe. The right object clearly shows a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal as described. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object's globe appears more natural, while the right object has a more complex structure due to the pedestal, which enhances its plausibility as described in the prompt.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left aligns with the shape of the globe. However, the right one maintains alignment between the globe and pedestal, showing better overall texture-geometry alignment.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object’s globe texture captures details appropriately, but the right object’s texture integrates these details on both globe and pedestal, providing a more complete representation. 
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has a simpler structure, but the right one adds detail with the pedestal, leading to a more intricate and realistic model. 
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object incorporates both the globe and pedestal effectively, aligning well with the prompt, showing plausible 3D design, and maintaining detailed texturing and geometry alignment.
The right one is better.
