Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) depicts a circular object with textural detail but does not clearly show a recognizable clock or alignment above a bookshelf.
   - The right one (object 2) more clearly shows a circular object with radial patterns that resemble a clock face and is positioned above what appears to be a structured, cuboid form that could resemble a bookshelf.

The right one (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
2 (Right is better)
