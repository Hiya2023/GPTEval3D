Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left object resembles a traditional doorknob with a spherical design and some additional structure.
   - The right object appears to be more of a simple spherical shape.
   - The left object is better as it more closely resembles the detailed elements of a "spherical doorknob."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and plausible as a structured doorknob.
   - The right object, while spherical, lacks additional structure typically seen in a doorknob.
   - The left object is better because it appears more complete and plausible as a doorknob model.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a more detailed and realistic texture, with reflections and highlights that indicate metallic material.
   - The right object is simpler and less detailed.
   - The left object is better due to its sharper and more realistic texture.
