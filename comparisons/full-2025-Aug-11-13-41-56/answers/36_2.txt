Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has decorative legs which are not specified in the prompt; the right model has a simple design more in line with "a square coffee table". 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more complex and less stable due to its ornate legs; the right model is simpler and more structurally sound.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture is less aligned with its complex geometry, while the right model has a more cohesive look.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are inconsistent and noisy; the right model has smoother and clearer textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model's geometry is less organized; the right model has cleaner lines and better-defined shapes.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model more accurately represents a square coffee table and is more visually coherent.
The right one is better.
