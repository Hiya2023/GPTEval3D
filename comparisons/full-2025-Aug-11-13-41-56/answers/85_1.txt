Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more cubic, resembling the prompt; the right one has tufted details that deviate from the simple "cubic ottoman" description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a simpler, more consistent shape; the right one has a more complex look that may appear less plausible for a cubic ottoman.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has consistent texture and geometry; the right one shows uneven alignment due to complex tufted textures.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has simpler, clearer textures; the right one's complex patterns are less clear and aligned.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one provides a clean, cohesive structure; the right one appears more disorganized with noisy details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering the criteria, the left one is more aligned with the prompt and has a better execution of textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
