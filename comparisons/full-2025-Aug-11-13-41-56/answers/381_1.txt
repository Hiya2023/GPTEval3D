Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a desk, which aligns with the "rectangular desk" in the prompt. However, it doesn't clearly show a cylindrical bin.
   - The right object resembles a cylindrical shape, which corresponds to a "cylindrical bin." However, it lacks any representation of a desk.
   - Cannot decide as neither perfectly represents both aspects of the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has a plausible desk structure with legs and a top, but the cylindrical part is absent.
   - The right object appears as a solid, plausible cylindrical bin but lacks complexity or representation of a desk.
   - Cannot decide as both objects display strengths in different areas.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more detail and variety in color and texture, enhancing realism for the desk.
   - The right object has a simpler texture. Though distinct, it's less detailed than the left object's texture.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
3 3 1
