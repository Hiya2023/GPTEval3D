Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model features a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests, aligning with the description.
   - The right model lacks clear cylindrical armrests and a defined rectangular structure.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has a more discernible structure, displaying a rectangular sofa shape and positioning.
   - The right model appears less defined and more abstract.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's textures appear to follow the sofa's geometry closely, with details consistent across images.
   - The right model lacks distinct alignment, with textures not clearly defining shapes.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model captures more detailed textures, with visible patterns and colors consistent across views.
   - The right model appears more abstract and lacks detail.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model shows more intricate and organized geometry, aligning with the structure of a sofa.
   - The right model features less defined geometry, appearing noisy.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering alignment, plausibility, and detail consistency, the left model is superior.
   The left one is better.
