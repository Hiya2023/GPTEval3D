Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a spherical object, but the pedestal is less defined and not clearly cubic.
   - The right one shows a more detailed globe with distinct landmasses and sits on a more defined cubic pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks lacking in detail and solidity, with the pedestal blending into the background.
   - The right one has a more structured appearance, though the landmasses are blocky, the overall form seems more plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one appears to have a smoother but less detailed texture overall.
   - The right one contains more texture details, especially noticeable in the globe's surface and pedestal.
   - The right one is better.
