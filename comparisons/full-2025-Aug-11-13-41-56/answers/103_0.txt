Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features a spherical lamp and a clearly defined square nightstand. The right model includes these elements but with less definition in the structures.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and solid, with proper lamp proportions. The right one has less accurate proportions and more noise.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows good alignment between geometry and texture, with clear lamp features. The right one displays mismatched features.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer texture details without blur. The right model appears more abstract and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model presents intricate, organized geometry. The right model is noisier with less meaningful detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more aligned with the prompt, more plausible, and exhibits better detail and texture alignment.
The left one is better.
