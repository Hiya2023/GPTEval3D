Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has irregular shapes, and itâ€™s unclear if it represents a stool and sofa; the right one looks like a round stool and a rectangular sofa. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has unnatural shapes and structures; the right one has more plausible shapes for the stool and sofa. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has misaligned textures and geometry; the right one shows better alignment between textures and shapes. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is blurry and lacks detail; the right one captures finer, clearer details. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has disorganized geometry; the right one is smoother and more cohesive. The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right one consistently performs better across all criteria. The right one is better.
