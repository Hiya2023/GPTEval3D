Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1):** The shape is more irregular and the edges do not appear smooth or rounded. It loosely resembles a triangular shape but lacks the clarity in form.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The shape is more defined as a triangular shelf with smoother edges that are closer to being rounded. The form is more faithful to the text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
