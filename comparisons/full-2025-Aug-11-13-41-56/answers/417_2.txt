Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left model (object 1) appears to depict a rectangular sofa. However, there's no clear indication of an oval mirror.
   - The right model (object 2) also depicts a sofa, and similar to the left model, it lacks any explicit representation of an oval mirror.
   - Both models primarily illustrate the sofa, and neither fulfills the mirror aspect of the prompt effectively. 
   - **Cannot decide**.

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - The left model (object 1) seems to have more coherent and less noisy 3D structure, showing a solid and identifiable sofa shape without any apparent distortions.
   - The right model (object 2) appears less solid, with some parts looking fragmented or noisy, which affects its plausibility.
   - **Left (object 1) is better**.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 
   - The left model (object 1) possesses sharper and more detailed textures on the sofa, contributing to a more realistic appearance.
   - The right model (object 2) has less refined textures, making it appear less detailed and realistic.
   - **Left (object 1) is better**.

Final answer:
