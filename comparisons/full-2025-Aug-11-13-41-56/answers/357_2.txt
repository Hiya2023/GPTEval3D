Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a single piece of furniture that resembles a cushioned seating area, possibly a sofa. It does not clearly depict both a round stool and a rectangular sofa.
   - The right one shows two distinct objects: a smaller, round object beside a larger, rectangular object, which aligns more closely with the prompt of "a round stool beside a rectangular sofa."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is a cohesive single object but does not accurately represent two distinct items. The structure seems solid and unified.
   - The right one effectively presents two separate objects, although the shapes are somewhat abstract. However, they plausibly represent a stool and a sofa.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a consistent texture with some definition, although it lacks sharpness.
   - The right one shows more textural detail on both objects, making the representations appear more realistic and detailed.
   - The right one is better.
