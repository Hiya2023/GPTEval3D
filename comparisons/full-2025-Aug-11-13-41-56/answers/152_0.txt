Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object is a still, hexagonal shape that resembles a mirror.
   - The right object appears more fragmented and complex, not strongly resembling a hexagonal mirror.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears as a solid and consistent mirror shape.
   - The right object has irregular structures that do not resemble a realistic or coherent shape.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object's hexagonal structure is consistent in both RGB and normal maps.
   - The right object's texture and shape appear misaligned and chaotic.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left object has clean and clear textures appropriate for a mirror.
   - The right object appears with overly complex and unclear textures.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has a well-defined hexagonal structure.
   - The right object has a noisy and fragmented appearance.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left one is better in all aspects.
