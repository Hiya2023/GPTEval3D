Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears as a more traditional round cushion, fitting the description well with a circular shape and cushion-like structure.
   - The right one resembles more of a floral pattern or organic shape and doesn't align as well with the description of a "round cushion."
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a solid, plausible cushion with clearly defined shape and consistent structure.
   - The right one seems to have an unusual, plant-like surface that doesn't seem structurally plausible as a cushion.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one exhibits a detailed texture with clear patterns, enhancing its realistic appearance.
   - The right one's texture is less defined and appears more abstract or noisy.
   - The left one is better.
