Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a simple cubic structure which aligns with the prompt "A cubic ottoman."
   - The right one, while having an ottoman-like shape, has bold, colorful textures that may distract from a classic interpretation.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a realistic and solid cubic ottoman with standard features.
   - The right one seems to have a plausible structure but is possibly affected by the exaggerated textures which may reduce normalcy.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a relatively uniform texture that appears less detailed or sharp.
   - The right one has more vibrant colors and visually richer textures, though they may feel atypical for an ottoman.
   - The right one is better.
