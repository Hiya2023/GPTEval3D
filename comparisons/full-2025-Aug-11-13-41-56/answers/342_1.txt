Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model seems to depict a rectangular sofa, but lacks the presence of a round stool.
   - The right model also appears to depict a rectangular sofa, but similarly lacks a stool.
   - Both models fail to include all the attributes from the text prompt, but they partially match the "rectangular sofa" aspect.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks more solid and plausible as an object. It does not exhibit strange body problems or duplicated parts.
   - The right model appears more fragmented and less coherent, with visible holes and irregularities.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model's texture is sharper and more realistic, providing more detailed and coherent surfaces.
   - The right model's texture seems less detailed and more uniform.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
