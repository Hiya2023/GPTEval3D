Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has both the desk and a cylindrical object; the right one shows both objects clearly. 
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has decent proportions; the right one appears more solid with proper shapes.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows some misalignment in the desk structure; the right one exhibits good texture to shape adherence.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears blurry in places; the right one maintains finer detail.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has some geometry noise; the right one shows more coherent details.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one covers all criteria well, maintaining alignment, plausibility, and detail.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
