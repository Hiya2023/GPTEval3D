Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a cubic shape for the lamp and a visible curved base, aligning well with the text prompt "A cubic lamp with a curved base."
   - The right one does not clearly represent a cubic lamp or a curved base.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more solid and structurally coherent, presenting a plausible 3D form with a defined shape.
   - The right one appears less defined and has a noisier structure, looking less plausible as a 3D object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper and more detailed textures, particularly in the base and edges.
   - The right one lacks detail and presents a more blurred texture.
   - The left one is better.
