Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) has an elliptical top with circular legs, which aligns well with the prompt "An elliptical coffee table with circular legs."
   - The right one (object 2) also has an elliptical top and circular legs, fitting the description adequately, but the renderings are brighter and slightly less detailed.

Final answer:
1 (Left is better)
