Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

   - **Left (Object 1):** Only a triangular object appears, and it resembles a traffic cone, but there is no circular ball present. The background appears unrelated to the text prompt.
   
   - **Right (Object 2):** A triangular traffic cone is clear, but similarly, there's no circular ball visible. The focus is more on the traffic cone, which matches part of the prompt.

Right object better captures the triangular traffic cone.

Final answer:
2 (Right is better)
