Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear, spherical shape with a protruding base, resembling a traditional doorknob.
   - The right one is more compact and spherical but lacks clear features that identify it as a doorknob.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and coherent with recognizable doorknob features like a mountable base.
   - The right one, although spherical, seems overly simplified and lacks realistic doorknob structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one displays detailed texturing, especially in the metallic surface and reflections.
   - The right one has smoother textures but lacks the detail and realism of the left one.
   - The left one is better.
