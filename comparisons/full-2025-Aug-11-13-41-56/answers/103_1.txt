Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model clearly shows a spherical lamp and a square nightstand. The right model is unclear in depicting elements from the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more natural and solid with appropriate proportions. The right model has irregular structures.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's shape and texture align well locally. The right model suffers from misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures finer details clearly. The right model seems blurry and lacks detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits well-organized geometry without noise. The right model has disorganized geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model excels in all criteria evaluated.
The left one is better.
