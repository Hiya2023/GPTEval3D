Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - Left: The left object looks like a globe with detailed textures resembling a world map. However, it lacks a visible cubic pedestal.
   - Right: The right object has a spherical shape on what appears to be a cubic pedestal, though the pedestal is more rounded.
   - The right one is better for including both elements of the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: The globe appears realistic with detailed textures but lacks a clearly defined sequence of plausible 3D structures, especially for the pedestal.
   - Right: The model looks solid with a clearer division between the globe and pedestal, though the pedestal's shape is not perfectly cubic.
   - The right one is better for having a more solid and plausible structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - Left: The textures are varied and colorful, closely resembling a real globe.
   - Right: The textures are smoother and less detailed compared to the left one.
   - The left one is better for having sharper and more realistic textures.
