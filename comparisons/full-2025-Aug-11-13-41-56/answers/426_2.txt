Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model shows a more complex design with irregular shapes and colors, which deviates from a traditional rectangular bookshelf. 
   - The right model resembles a typical rectangular bookshelf more closely with straight lines and uniform shelves.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears less coherent, with potentially noisy structures and irregular parts.
   - The right model looks more solid and plausible as a bookshelf, with clearly defined shelves and structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has mixed textures that seem noisy, with less definition.
   - The right model features more consistent and realistic textures, with better sharpness and detail.
   - The right one is better.
