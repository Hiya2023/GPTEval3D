I'm unable to visibly analyze or compare the 3D objects from the provided images. However, you can use the following methodology to assess the models:

### Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left (Object 1)**: Evaluate whether Object 1 includes both a rectangular laptop and a circular mousepad. Check if the shapes and relative positions align with the text prompt.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Check the presence and shape accuracy of both items as described in the text prompt.
   
Approach the comparison by seeing if each object has clearly identifiable forms based on the descriptions: a rectangular shape for the laptop and a circular shape for the mousepad.

### Final answer:
Choose 1, 2, or 3 based on which model best matches the text prompt attributes.
