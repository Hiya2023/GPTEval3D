Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- The left one (object 1) has a more irregular, organic shape with jagged edges, not reflecting the "triangular" description accurately. The edges are not rounded and appear sharp and rugged.

- The right one (object 2) has a clear triangular shape with smooth, rounded edges, aligning more closely with the text prompt. The shelves are distinct and maintain the triangular form.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
