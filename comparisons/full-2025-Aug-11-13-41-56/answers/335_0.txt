Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is a yellow pyramid-shaped object on top of a red cylinder. It doesn't resemble a triangular road sign.
   - The right model is a traditional road sign with a triangular shape at the top, aligning well with the concept of a triangular road sign.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears abstract and lacks a solid, coherent structure. The geometry seems strange for a road sign.
   - The right model is more realistic and resembles an actual road sign with a clear pole and sign structure.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a simple and less detailed texture, appearing abstract.
   - The right model has a more detailed and realistic texture, especially on the sign face.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
