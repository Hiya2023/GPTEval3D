Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one appears as a diamond shape rather than a typical triangle, which does not align well with the prompt "triangular road sign." The right one has a clearer triangular shape that fits the description. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object seems to have irregularities and a less stable appearance. The right object looks more uniform and solid as a triangular road sign should. 
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The texture on the left object is brighter and more vivid but lacks realistic detail. The right object has slightly more texture detail and appears more realistic. 
The right one is better.
