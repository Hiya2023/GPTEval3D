Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a conical lampshade, but the base also appears conical rather than cylindrical.
   - The right one has a clear conical lampshade and a more distinct cylindrical base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and has fewer distortions.
   - The right one has some odd textures and lighting inconsistencies.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has visible texture patterns and some details.
   - The right one has smoother textures, but fewer details.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
