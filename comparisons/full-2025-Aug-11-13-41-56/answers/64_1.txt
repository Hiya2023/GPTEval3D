Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a rectangular road sign, not triangular as the prompt describes. The right object has a diamond shape, closer to triangular, with an arrow.  
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object is consistent in shape with a typical road sign post, albeit not triangular. The right object has a more authentic road sign appearance despite irregularities. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows better alignment between the texture and geometry, appearing integrated. The right object has some misalignment, affecting its realism.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object appears consistent in texture but lacks detail. The right object shows clear, realistic textures on the sign.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object has a smoother geometry but lacks details. The right object has distinctive details despite some roughness.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering alignment with the prompt and the realism of textures and geometry:
The right one is better.
