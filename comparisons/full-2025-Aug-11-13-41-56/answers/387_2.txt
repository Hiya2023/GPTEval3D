Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**: 

   - The left object is a spherical shape with a base, which closely resembles a classic doorknob.
   - The right object is also spherical but includes a connecting structure to a surface, suggesting a more traditional doorknob installation.
   - The right one is better as it aligns more closely with the idea of a "doorknob" being attached to a door.
  
2. **3D Plausibility**: 

   - The left object appears as a solid, smooth sphere with a plausible base.
   - The right object is not only spherical but has additional components that enhance its believability as a doorknob, though the textures are less coherent.
   - The left one is better as it appears more normal and solid with a cohesive design.

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 

   - The left object has a smooth, uniform texture with good reflective qualities, enhancing the realistic appearance.
   - The right objectâ€™s texture appears more distorted and noisy.
   - The left one is better for having a sharper and more realistic texture.
