Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a cubic lamp with a distinct base that could be interpreted as curved due to the shadow and light play.
   - The right one has a less defined structure, making it challenging to identify a cubic form or a curved base.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more solid and structured, resembling a plausible lamp with a clear cubic shape.
   - The right one appears somewhat abstract and lacks a coherent structure, with noisy parts evident.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows sharper textures with more detail around the edges and the light source.
   - The right one is blurred and lacks distinct texture details.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
