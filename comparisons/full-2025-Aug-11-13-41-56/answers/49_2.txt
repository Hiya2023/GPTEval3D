Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one resembles a road sign but not triangular; the right one is rectangular, not triangular. Neither aligns perfectly, but the left one is closer in shape.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and natural as a sign structure; the right one's rectangular form and post are less convincing.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s texture aligns awkwardly with its geometry; the right one’s texture better matches the rectangular shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more defined texture; the right one’s texture is less clear.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has more cohesive geometry details; the right one has less definition in structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, taking into account shape alignment and details, the left one better meets the prompt requirements for a road sign.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
