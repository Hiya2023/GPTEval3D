Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one is a simple spherical shape with a metallic appearance. The right one exhibits a more ornate design with additional decorative elements. The prompt specifies "a spherical doorknob," which is more closely matched by the left object due to its simple spherical form.

   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears solid and typical of a doorknob with no strange or duplicated parts. The right object, while detailed, seems less plausible due to its complex and non-standard design for a doorknob.

   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left object has a smooth, reflective metallic texture which is detailed and realistic for a metal surface. The right object, although more detailed, has a less sharp texture that appears less realistic in terms of material representation.

   The left one is better.

Final answer:
