Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model depicts a structure with a distinctive, uneven form. It seems disconnected and doesn't clearly represent a recognizable furniture shape from the prompt. 
   - The right model appears to be a sofa with a more cohesive form, though it still has some abstraction.

The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has visible issues with incomplete forms and irregular shapes, making it less plausible as a solid object.
   - The right model, although abstract, appears more cohesive and plausible as a sofa.

The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture is rough and lacks detail, making it appear unrealistic.
   - The right model has smoother, more detailed textures, which enhance realism.

The right one is better.
