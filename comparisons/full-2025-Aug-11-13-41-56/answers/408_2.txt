Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one (object 1) appears more abstract with a green spherical shape but lacks the distinct lamp and nightstand features described in the prompt.
   - The right one (object 2) clearly depicts a spherical object on a surface resembling a lamp on a nightstand.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one (object 1) appears less defined, with an unclear structure that doesnâ€™t resemble a realistic object.
   - The right one (object 2) appears more coherent, with solid, distinct features that represent the described objects well.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one (object 1) has a more uniform texture with less detail.
   - The right one (object 2) shows sharper, more detailed textures on the object and surface.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
