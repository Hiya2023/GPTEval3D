Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a clear spherical globe feature and includes some textural details that resemble a map, sitting on a cubic pedestal.
   - The right model appears to have a fragmented spherical shape with minimal detail and lacks a discernible pedestal.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model appears solid and maintains a clear globe shape with a stable looking pedestal.
   - The right model seems incomplete with fragmented parts and lacks coherence in structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model exhibits sharper and more detailed textures that are recognizable as map-like features.
   - The right model has less detail and lacks clear texture definition.
   - The left one is better.
