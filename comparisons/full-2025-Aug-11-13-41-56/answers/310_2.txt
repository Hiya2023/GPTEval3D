Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one clearly depicts a spherical globe on top of a cubic pedestal, aligning well with the prompt.
   - The right one appears to have a fragmented structure with no clear spherical globe or cubic pedestal, deviating from the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and cohesive, depicting a plausible 3D object without any strange structures.
   - The right one seems to have fragmented and non-cohesive parts, lacking a clear solid structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows sharper textures and more defined details on the globe.
   - The right one has less distinct textures and appears more blurred and undefined.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
