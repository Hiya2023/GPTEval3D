Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a rectangular shape but doesn't clearly show a mirror; the right model clearly displays a rectangular sofa and an oval mirror.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears less structured with irregular proportions; the right model presents a more natural and cohesive 3D structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture is not well aligned with its geometry; the right model shows better correspondence between the texture and the shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are less defined; the right model captures more detailed textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows less organized geometry; the right model exhibits more intricate and smooth geometry details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right model better fulfills the criteria and aligns with the prompt.
The right one is better.
