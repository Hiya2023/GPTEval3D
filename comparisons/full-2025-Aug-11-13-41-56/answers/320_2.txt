Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The structure appears to have round and rectangular forms, but the bright, multicolored pattern doesn't resemble typical stool or sofa textures.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: This model has more distinct shapes that resemble a round stool and a rectangular sofa, with a more realistic texture.
   - **The right one is better.**

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The model seems less coherent, with potential issues like noisy textures and unclear structures.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The shapes are clearer and more plausible as furniture pieces, with more defined structures.
   - **The right one is better.**

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The textures are colorful but lack detail and realism.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The textures are sharper and more realistic, with finer details.
   - **The right one is better.**

Final answer:
