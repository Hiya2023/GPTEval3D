Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model looks like an oval dining table more accurately. The right model also captures the oval shape, but the left one seems more aligned with a traditional table structure.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has a more solid and natural appearance, with realistic proportions. The right model's structure feels less stable.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture aligns well with its geometry, maintaining consistency in both the RGB and normal maps. The right model shows some misalignment in texture and shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model effectively captures fine details without blurring, maintaining a consistent aesthetic. The right model appears less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits well-organized contours and intricate details, while the right model lacks some precision in structure.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left model is more accurate and visually appealing.
The left one is better.
