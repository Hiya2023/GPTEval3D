Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a simple cubic shape but lacks detail; the right one is more complex and colorful but does not closely resemble the simple description. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural and solid with its simple shape. The right one is overly detailed and less plausible for a cubic ottoman. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns with its geometry effectively. The right one's texture is more complex but does not match the geometry accurately. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one effectively captures fine details with simplicity. The right one is too noisy. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a more organized and efficient structure with its smooth surface. The right one seems cluttered. The left one is better.

6. Overall: Considering all aspects, the left one better represents a cubic ottoman.
