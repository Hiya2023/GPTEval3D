I'm unable to compare images or make judgments about them. However, I can guide you on what you should be looking for based on the criteria provided:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: Evaluate which model better matches the description of a "spherical doorknob." Check for accurate representation of a sphere and features typical of a doorknob.

2. **3D Plausibility**: Look for which model has more natural and believable 3D structure. Consider the proportions and any signs of anomalies like duplication or meaningless structure.

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment**: Assess how well the texture fits the 3D structure. The texture should enhance the realism of the spherical shape and appear natural on the surface.

4. **Low-Level Texture Details**: Evaluate the clarity and precision of textures. Look for one that captures fine details authentically without unnecessary abstraction.

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details**: Examine the details in the normal map to see which model has a more organized and detailed structure, avoiding noise.

6. **Overall**: Based on the evaluations from the above criteria, decide which model overall looks more plausible, realistic, and better aligned with the prompt.

Whether you find them better or indistinguishable in these aspects will direct the decision.
