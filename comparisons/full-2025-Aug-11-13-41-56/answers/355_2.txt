Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more like a circular stool with a round base but lacks the square base from the prompt.
   - The right one also has a circular stool and base but similarly lacks a square base. 
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks normal and solid, with no strange or duplicated structures.
   - The right one has a more rough and undefined structure that seems less plausible as a solid object.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has less discernible details and appears somewhat blurry.
   - The right one, despite being rough, has more visible textural details.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
