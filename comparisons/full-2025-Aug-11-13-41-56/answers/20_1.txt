Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has intricate legs but doesn't appear square, while the right is simpler but more consistent with a square table shape. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has complex leg designs that seem less natural, whereas the right model has standard, solid-looking legs and appears more normal.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has more detailed textures, but the geometry doesn't match well. The right model has better alignment between texture and shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has elaborate textures that appear slightly blurry, while the right model's textures are clear and appropriate for a table.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows more complex geometry, but it lacks coherence. The right model is straightforward with efficient geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right model is more aligned with the prompt and has better overall quality.
The right one is better.
