Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a rectangular form with no triangular shape; the right one resembles a triangular shape with round edges.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks like a standard shelf with a plausible structure; the right one appears uniquely shaped but could pass as a creative shelf.
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows consistent textures and geometry; the right one has textures aligned with the geometric structure.
Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clearer details in the texture; the right one seems slightly noisy but captures the design.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a more defined structure with smooth surfaces; the right one has some irregularities in the shape.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the right one aligns more with the prompt due to its shape, but the left one excels in texture and detail quality.
The right one is better.


Final answer:
2 3 3 1 1 2
