Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model is more of a rectangular shelf and lacks triangular shapes. 
   - The right model resembles a triangular shape with visible rounded edges.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model appears more like a solid, plausible shelf structure.
   - The right model, while triangular, may seem less sturdy due to its abstract form.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left model's texture conforms better to its geometry.
   - The right model's textures align well, but its abstract shape makes coherence less evident.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model shows better-defined textures, with clearer features.
   - The right model has textures clearly visible, but they are abstract.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left model depicts clearer and more organized geometric details.
   - The right model has simple geometric textures with some noise.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   The left one is better because it exhibits greater structural plausibility and texture detail despite lacking a triangular shape.

Final answer:
