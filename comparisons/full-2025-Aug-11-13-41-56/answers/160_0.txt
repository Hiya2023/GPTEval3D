Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one more clearly resembles a sofa with obvious armrests, though the shape is a bit inconsistent; the right one lacks clear structure and detail relevant to the prompt. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more defined structure despite some irregularities; the right one appears mostly formless and less plausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows some alignment between texture and geometry, though not perfect; the right one has a noisy texture with poor geometric correspondence.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one contains some visible texture details; the right one is overly abstract and lacks coherent detail.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has more defined geometrical features; the right one lacks detail and coherence.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the left one more closely matches the criteria and prompt.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
