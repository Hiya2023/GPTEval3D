Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a square top but lacks distinct, visible legs.
   - The right one shows a clear square table with visible legs.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears less solid with undefined legs.
   - The right one has proper proportions and solid structure.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has misaligned textures that do not match the structure well.
   - The right one shows good alignment between textures and geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one's textures are less defined and appear blurry.
   - The right one has clear and detailed textures.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has noisy geometry without clear detail.
   - The right one shows better-defined geometry with smooth surfaces.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   Considering all aspects, the right one accurately reflects the prompt, appears more plausible, and has better detail, texture alignment, and geometry.
   The right one is better.
