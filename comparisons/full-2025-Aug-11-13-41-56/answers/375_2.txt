Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear rectangular shape with cylindrical armrests, closely matching the prompt.
   - The right one appears irregular with unclear armrests and doesn't align well with the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a coherent, solid piece of furniture with no apparent structural issues.
   - The right one has an irregular and noisy structure that appears implausible as a solid object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has smoother textures, but lacks sharpness and detail.
   - The right one has more texture detailing, though it appears noisy and unrealistic.
   - The left one is better.
