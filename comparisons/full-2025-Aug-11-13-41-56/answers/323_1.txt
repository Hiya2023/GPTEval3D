I'm unable to view the images in detail, but I can guide you in comparing them based on the criteria you provided:

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Appears to have a hexagonal shape that could represent a table. Consider if it visually aligns with being under a round mirror.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Evaluate if thereâ€™s any visible structure resembling a hexagonal table or components that might suggest being under a mirror.
   - **Decision:** Choose which object better represents "A hexagonal table under a round mirror."

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Check for any irregularities, such as strange shapes, duplicated parts, or chaotic structures. Consider the solidity and normality of the form.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, investigate for any anomalies or unrealistic features.
   - **Decision:** Decide which model appears more solid and plausible.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Focus on clarity, detail, and sharpness of textures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Analyze the texture quality and realism.
   - **Decision:** Determine which model has sharper and more detailed textures.

### Final Answer:
Decide based on your examination for each criterion, then summarize your final decision like this example: "1 2 2" or "3 3 3".
