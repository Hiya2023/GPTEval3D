Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a simplistic appearance but lacks detail, whereas the right one has elaborate floral patterns not entirely fitting the prompt of a "round cushion."
   Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural and cushion-like in shape, whereas the right one has irregular protrusions.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one lacks distinct texture detail but has a consistent shape-texture alignment. The right one has notable texture but with misaligned geometry at some points.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one is plain with rudimentary texture; the right one shows detailed floral textures, aligning with more intricate designs.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one maintains a smoother, rounded shape reflective of a cushion. The right one has some irregular shapes and distortions.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, taking into account a well-aligned, plausible cushion shape, the left one better fits the prompt.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
