Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears as a round cushion and aligns well with the text prompt.
   - The right one is more irregular and does not resemble a typical cushion shape.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid and plausible as a cushion with a consistent shape.
   - The right one appears rough and irregular, with an unlikely cushion structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a sharper, more realistic texture that mimics fabric.
   - The right one has a noisy and inconsistent texture.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
