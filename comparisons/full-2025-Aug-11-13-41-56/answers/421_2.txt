Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one: The object has a triangular shape but also includes additional elements such as text and symbols that are not typically present on a simple triangular road sign.
   - The right one: Clearly represents a simple triangular road sign with no additional features.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Exhibits some irregularities in structure with additional elements that disrupt the basic form.
   - The right one: Appears more solid and has a consistent triangular shape that is expected for a road sign.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Textures include more elements like text and symbols, but they seem less sharp.
   - The right one: Textures appear smoother and consistent with a typical road sign.
   - The right one is better.
