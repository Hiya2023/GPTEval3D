Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a diamond shape which is less aligned with the "triangular" prompt.
   - The right one better represents a triangular shape as specified in the prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have an irregular shape and lacks definition, making it look less solid.
   - The right one has a more defined triangular structure and appears more stable and plausible.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a somewhat blurred texture with less detail.
   - The right one has sharper texture details and looks more realistic.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2
