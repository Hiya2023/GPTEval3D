Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a consistent rectangular structure but lacks clear cylindrical armrests.
   - The right one also has a rectangular structure and depicts clearer cylindrical armrests.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one displays more natural and cohesive shapes, despite missing clear armrests.
   - The right one appears more realistic with recognizable armrests and overall form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's texture does not closely match its geometry.
   - The right one has a better alignment between the texture and the geometry, especially with the cushion details.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left oneâ€™s textures appear more blurred and less detailed.
   - The right one features more refined texture details, especially on the cushions.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one lacks intricate details and appears smoother.
   - The right one demonstrates more intricate geometry with better detailing.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one consistently meets more criteria effectively.
   - The right one is better.
