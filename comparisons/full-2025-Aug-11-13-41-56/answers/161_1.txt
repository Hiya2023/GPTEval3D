Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one depicts a spherical lamp on a square base, consistent with "a spherical lamp on a square nightstand." The right one shows a different lamp design, less aligned with the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has more natural shapes and proportions for a lamp. The right model appears more abstract with less plausible features.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures adhere well to the geometry, showing clear alignment in both views. The right one shows mismatched elements.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clear, defined textures that match typical lamp details. The right one appears noisy without distinct details.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows smooth and organized geometry representing a lamp effectively. The right one has irregular and noisy geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object better meets all criteria outlined above.
The left one is better.
