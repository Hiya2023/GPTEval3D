Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a rectangular road sign with directional arrows and text, attached to a post, which does not match the "triangular" aspect of the prompt.
   - The right one is a triangular shape mounted on a post, aligning with the "triangular road sign" description.

   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a coherent rectangular sign on a post, typical for road signs.
   - The right one is a triangular sign, but the patterning and colors (yellow and black stripes) could seem unusual for traditional road signs, though it remains plausible.

   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one exhibits clearer and more detailed text and arrows, showing typical road sign characteristics.
   - The right one has more vivid colors but less detailed patterns compared to the realistic details on the left one.

   The left one is better.
