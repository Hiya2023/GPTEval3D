Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object shows a round stool beside a rectangular sofa, which aligns well with the prompt.
   - The right object does not clearly depict a round stool or a recognizable sofa.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears more structurally sound and plausible, with identifiable parts.
   - The right object seems to have strange and unclear structures, making it less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more defined textures and detailed features, such as the patterns on the cushions.
   - The right object's texture appears blurred and lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.
