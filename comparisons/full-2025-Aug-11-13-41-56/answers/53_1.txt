Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one looks more like a conventional shelf but lacks triangular features; the right one has a triangular shape and round edges aligning with the prompt. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and structured, while the right one has some irregularities in shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s textures align well with its straightforward geometry; the right one has texture alignment issues.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clearer textures without blurriness; the right one’s textures appear uneven.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has neat and efficient geometry; the right one contains less organized details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one is more solid but lacks alignment with the prompt. The right one fits the prompt but is less plausible.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
2 1 1 1 1 2
