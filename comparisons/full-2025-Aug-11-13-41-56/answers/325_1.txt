Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears more oval with thin, elongated legs, which are less circular.
   - The right model has a more defined elliptical top with circular legs.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks less solid and appears distorted with unclear structure.
   - The right model is more solid and maintains a clearer, plausible shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture is less defined and blurry.
   - The right model has sharper and more detailed texture.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
