Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object looks more like a simple coffee table with a square top, aligning with the basic structure described in the prompt.
   - The right object also has a square top, but it includes more ornate legs and detailing, which might extend beyond a basic interpretation of the prompt.
   - Conclusion: Left is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid and compact, although a bit simplistic and lacking details in structure.
   - The right object seems more structurally plausible as a table, with defined legs and a clear top, despite its more complex design.
   - Conclusion: Right is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a uniform texture, but it lacks sharpness and details.
   - The right object showcases more detailed textures and sharper contrasts in the rendering.
   - Conclusion: Right is better.
