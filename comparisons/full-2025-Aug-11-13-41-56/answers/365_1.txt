Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a spherical lamp on a square base, closely aligning with the prompt "A spherical lamp on a square nightstand." 
   - The right one shows a spherical shape but lacks the clear depiction of a lamp or a square base.
   
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more structured with distinct components, suggesting a more plausible 3D object with a lamp and base.
   - The right one appears as a simple sphere with less detail and distinction, making it less plausible as a lamp on a nightstand.
   
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one displays more detail and variation in texture, with distinct features like the lamp and base.
   - The right one has a softer texture and lacks detail, appearing more blurred.
   
   The left one is better.
