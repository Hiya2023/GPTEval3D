Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one has a more basic square shape with minimal detail; the right one also has a square shape but with more detailed legs. The left is simpler while the right has more attributes that could correspond to a typical coffee table.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks somewhat distorted and less solid, while the right one appears more stable and structured. The right one has a more plausible and realistic 3D form.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has less detail and appears more blurry, while the right one displays a sharper, more detailed texture on the table surface and legs.
The right one is better.
