Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model: This features a rectangular sofa positioned beside an oval mirror, well aligning with the text prompt.
   - The right model: This also displays a rectangular sofa but lacks the presence of a mirror as described.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model: Appears solid and plausible with consistent shapes, though the mirror placement is unusual.
   - The right model: Seems to show a coherent sofa structure without odd features or noise.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model: Displays textures that appear smooth but lack sharpness and detail.
   - The right model: Has sharper textures and more detailed local features, giving a more realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.
