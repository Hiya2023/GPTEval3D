Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a more spherical shape with a distinct flat seat area, which aligns closely with the prompt "a spherical chair with a flat seat."
   - The right one has a more complex appearance with irregular protrusions, which deviates from the spherical and flat characteristics mentioned in the prompt.
   
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears solid and is free of any strange or duplicated parts, presenting a plausible chair structure.
   - The right one has irregular features and seems less plausible as a functional object, possibly due to the fragmented parts.

   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a relatively smoother and more uniform texture, suitable for a chair.
   - The right one shows more noise and less realistic detailing in terms of texture.

   The left one is better.

Final answer:
