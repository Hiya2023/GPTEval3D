Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (object 1): The model depicts two objects, neither clearly resembling a stool or a sofa. The shapes are ambiguous and do not match the description of a round stool or a rectangular sofa.
   - Right (object 2): The model also depicts two objects, but the shapes are clearer, with one object resembling a rectangular form which could be interpreted as a sofa. However, the round stool is not distinctly identifiable.
   
The right one is better for partially matching the rectangular sofa description, but neither fully meets the prompt.

Final answer:
2
