Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (Object 1) clearly represents a hexagonal mirror, as reflected in its geometry. However, it lacks the triangular frame described in the prompt.
   - The right object (Object 2) depicts a diamond shape, which does not match the hexagonal description, but includes a frame similar to a triangular pattern when viewed from the side. 

The left one better fulfills the requirement for a hexagonal shape, but the right one includes a frame aspect more closely resembling "triangular."

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
