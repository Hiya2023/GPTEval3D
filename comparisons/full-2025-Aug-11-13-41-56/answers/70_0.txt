Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a complex pattern, which deviates from the simplicity of "a cubic ottoman." 
   - The right object is more straightforward and matches the cubic shape described.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object's pattern is visually interesting but not very plausible as an ottoman.
   - The right object appears more solid and appropriately proportioned.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object shows a mismatch between texture and shape, with the pattern not aligning well.
   - The right object's texture and shape align more closely.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object's textures are complex but seem noisy.
   - The right object's textures are clear and align with the simplicity expected of an ottoman.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has intricate shapes but doesn't reflect the simplicity of the prompt.
   - The right object's simplicity aligns better with the intended design.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the right object more accurately represents a "cubic ottoman" with appropriate textures and geometry.
   The right one is better.
