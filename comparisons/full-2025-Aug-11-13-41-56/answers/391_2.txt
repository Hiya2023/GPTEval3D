Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts a spherical globe with detailed surface textures resembling a geographic map, but there is no visible pedestal.
   - The right one clearly shows a spherical object on a distinct pedestal, aligning with the text prompt of "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a recognizable globe shape with a detailed surface, but lacks solidity due to unclear base structure, leading to implausibility as a complete model.
   - The right one is more solid with a clear structure, having both a globe and a pedestal, making it more plausible as a 3D object.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more detailed and colorful texture on the globe's surface, resembling a map with various geographical features.
   - The right one has smoother textures with less detail and variation compared to the left model.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
