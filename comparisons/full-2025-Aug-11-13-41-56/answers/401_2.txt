Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to depict a sofa with ornate features but seems to focus more on the shapes and ornamental aspects rather than clearly showing a rectangular sofa or an oval mirror.
   - The right one resembles a sofa-like structure, but again lacks clear definition of a rectangular shape or an accompanying mirror.
   - Cannot decide which better matches the text prompt as both have unclear correspondence to "a rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model, although ornate, seems solid and maintains a coherent structure.
   - The right model looks fragmented, with parts appearing noisy and less cohesive, making it less plausible as a 3D object.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has more defined and visually distinct textures, with more color differentiation and detail.
   - The right model appears more uniform and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
