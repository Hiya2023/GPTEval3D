Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object (1) is hexagonal but lacks a clear triangular frame.
   - The right object (2) has a hexagonal mirror with hints of a triangular frame structure.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears more solid with defined structures.
   - The right object seems less solid and more abstract.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object has a misalignment between RGB and normal maps; shapes don't clearly match.
   - The right objectâ€™s texture aligns better with its geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left object has sharper, more detailed textures.
   - The right object has less crisp textures but captures some details.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has more organized and intricate geometry.
   - The right object lacks detailed geometry and appears smoother.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   The left object is more solid and detailed but lacks in frame depiction; the right object aligns better with the prompt. Overall, considering the prompt, the right is slightly better.

Final answer:
2 1 2 1 1 2
