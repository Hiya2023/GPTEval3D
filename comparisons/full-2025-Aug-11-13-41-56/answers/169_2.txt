Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one lacks an obvious mirror and doesn't clearly show a sofa; the right one clearly shows a sofa and an oval mirror.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears less structured and plausible; the right one has a more realistic arrangement with distinct objects.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has poor alignment between texture and geometry; the right one shows better alignment with distinct objects.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks detailed textures; the right one has more defined and coherent textures.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks detailed geometry; the right one has more structured details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one accurately represents the prompt with better structure and details.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
