Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a simple structure with a square top and slightly tapered legs, corresponding to a basic table design.
   - The right one features a more elaborate design with turned legs and a slightly ornate top.
   The right one is better in aligning with the idea of a decorative "coffee table" which often implies some design elements.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid and has a consistent structure without noticeable defects.
   - The right one, while having a more ornate design, maintains its plausibility with no strange or duplicated elements.
   Cannot decide, as both are plausible in their respective styles.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one's texture appears softer and lacks detail.
   - The right one has sharper and more detailed textures, especially around the edges and legs.
   The right one is better in terms of texture detail.
