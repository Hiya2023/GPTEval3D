Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to depict a rectangular sofa with some intricacies in shape but lacks a visible mirror.
   - The right model also seems to portray a sofa with a similar complexity and is missing an apparent mirror.
   - Both models do not clearly incorporate an "oval mirror."
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has a more cohesive structure and appears more solid without obvious abnormalities.
   - The right model seems less structured and has irregularities that affect its solidity.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model displays sharper and more detailed textures, especially visible in the fabric rendering.
   - The right modelâ€™s textures appear less defined and somewhat blurred.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
