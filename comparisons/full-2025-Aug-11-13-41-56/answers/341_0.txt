Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a conical shape but lacks a clear base. The design is floral and colorful, which doesn't match the prompt closely.
   - The right one clearly shows a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base, adhering more closely to the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears as a solid object with a coherent structure but the shape isn't fully representative of a lampshade.
   - The right one looks like a plausible lamp with distinct parts, a clear structure, and no oddities or duplications.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has vivid floral textures that are sharp and detailed.
   - The right one has a more realistic texture that matches a lamp but is less detailed compared to the left.
   - The left one is better.
