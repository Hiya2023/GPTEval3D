Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a square shape but appears distorted and uneven.
   - The right one is clearly a square coffee table with proper proportions.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has uneven and unrealistic proportions.
   - The right one appears more stable and realistic as a coffee table.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture does not align well with its uneven geometry.
   - The right model shows consistent alignment of texture to geometry.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one appears blurry with little detail.
   - The right one maintains sharper and clearer texture details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has irregular geometry without coherent details.
   - The right one shows well-defined geometry and structure.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   The right one consistently demonstrates better alignment, plausibility, and detail.
