Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more detailed and traditional table design but doesn't fit the "square" description perfectly. The right one clearly exemplifies a simple square coffee table.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has more complex textures that make it look less solid and more chaotic. The right one, however, appears more stable and plausible in shape.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture seems mismatched with its geometry, which is more evident in the RGB images. The right one's texture and geometry align better.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more intricate textures, but they appear disorganized. The right one's textures, while simpler, align better with the expected aesthetics.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has more chaotic geometry. The right one, though simplistic, maintains a coherent structure.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all the criteria, the right one effectively aligns with the description and maintains plausible and clean details.
The right one is better.
