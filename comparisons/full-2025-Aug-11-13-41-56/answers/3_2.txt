Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one clearly shows a square coffee table with a flat top and four legs.
   - The right one has a square shape but appears to have potential irregularities or overhanging parts not typical of a coffee table.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and natural without irregular body proportions.
   - The right one has unusual features which might affect its plausibility.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has consistent alignment of textures with its geometry.
   - The right one shows mismatched elements, with textures not properly aligning with its structure.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has clearer textures, maintaining detail without significant blurring.
   - The right one's textures seem more abstract and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows organized geometry without noticeable noise.
   - The right one has inconsistent geometry with undesired texture bits.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Consistent superiority across all criteria.
   The left one is better.
