Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one doesn't depict a clock and bookshelf clearly; The right one shows a clock but no bookshelf.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks detail in the clock face; The right one depicts the clock with numbers and hands.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has some inconsistencies; The right one aligns more effectively with clock details.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks detail; The right one has better clock face detail.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one is less defined; The right one has clearer geometry in the clock.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one is more detailed and aligned with the prompt.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
1 2 2 2 2 2
