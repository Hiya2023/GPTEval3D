Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model (object 1) effectively incorporates a hexagonal table, as seen in the multi-view images. However, it lacks a visible round mirror, which is part of the prompt.
   - The right model (object 2) also shows a hexagonal table, but with a more simplified design. Importantly, this model includes a round mirror positioned above the table, aligning well with the complete text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
