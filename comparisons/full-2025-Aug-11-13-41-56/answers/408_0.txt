Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: This object appears to be spherical but has a rough, uneven texture that may not completely align with the idea of a spherical lamp. The base is also irregular.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: This object is a smooth gold sphere on top of what appears to be a square or disc-shaped nightstand, closely resembling the description.
   
   The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The model looks unusual with its rough texture, making it look more like a rough organic object than a plausible lamp.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: Appears more solid and plausible as a lamp with no obvious structural issues.
   
   The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (Object 1)**: The texture is very uneven and lacks realism.
   - **Right (Object 2)**: The texture of the gold sphere is smooth and shiny, with more realistic details.
   
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
