Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model (object 1) does not appear to have a clear rectangular shape or distinct cylindrical armrests. The form seems irregular.
   - The right model (object 2) clearly shows a rectangular sofa shape and features cylindrical armrests, aligning closely with the text prompt.

The right one (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
2
