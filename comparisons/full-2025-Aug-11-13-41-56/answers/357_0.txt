Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object consists of a single red piece that appears more like a sofa but lacks the presence of a stool.
   - The right object has two separate pieces, one of which resembles a stool, and the other looks like a sofa.
   - The right object is better in aligning with the prompt "A round stool beside a rectangular sofa."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks like a coherent piece but lacks the existence of distinct entities (sofa and stool).
   - The right object successfully distinguishes between two entities, which appear as a sofa and a stool.
   - The right object is more plausible as a 3D model with distinct objects.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture appears sharper and has clearer details due to its coloration and clarity.
   - The right object's texture is less distinct, appearing more blurred and less realistic.
   - The left object has better low-level texture.

Final answer:
