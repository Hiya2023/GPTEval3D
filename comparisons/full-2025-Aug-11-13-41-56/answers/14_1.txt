Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one includes floral patterns, while the right one is plain. The right one aligns better with "a round cushion."
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has an irregular shape and extrusions. The right one appears more natural and cushion-like.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture doesn't align well with the geometry due to its complexity. The right one has a simpler, more aligned structure.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has detailed patterns, but they might not be suitable for "a round cushion." The right one has consistent texture details.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has noisy geometry due to its complex pattern, while the right one maintains a smooth and organized structure.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: The evaluations favor the right one, which resembles a round cushion more closely.
   The right one is better.
