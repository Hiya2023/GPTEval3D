Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one appears more disorganized and lacks clear definition in shape or structure. 
   - The right one more closely resembles a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests as described.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one seems chaotic and unrealistic in structure.
   - The right one appears more solid and plausible as a sofa.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one's texture does not align well with its structure, appearing mismatched and erratic.
   - The right one's texture aligns with its geometry, maintaining consistency.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one exhibits blurry and indistinct textures.
   - The right one has clearer, more defined textures that capture detail effectively.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one lacks clarity in its geometry, failing to capture intended shapes.
   - The right one has more intricate and organized geometry.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall: 
   Considering all aspects, the right one consistently aligns with the criteria better.
   The right one is better.
