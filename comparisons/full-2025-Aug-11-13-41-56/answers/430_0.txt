Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a detailed, textured appearance with multiple layers and a non-spherical shape.
   - The right model is smooth, round, and closely resembles a spherical doorknob.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has intricate details but appears less like a conventional doorknob due to its non-spherical shape.
   - The right model presents a more plausible spherical shape and looks solid.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a textured surface with visible details and patterns.
   - The right model has a smooth surface with a shiny appearance but less intricate texture.
   - The left one is better.
