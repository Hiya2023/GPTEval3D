Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a diamond-shaped sign with some additional markings and textures that don't align with the "triangular" description.
   - The right one is a clearer representation of a triangular shape, more in line with the prompt.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has more detailed textures but contains irregularities and protrusions that make it less plausible as a solid sign.
   - The right one, although simpler, appears more solid and consistent.
   The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has sharper, more detailed textures with visible markings and weathering.
   - The right one has a smoother, simpler texture with less detail.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
