Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: Appears to be a rectangular form with wooden legs, resembling a sofa structure but missing clarity on the round stool.
   - The right one: Exhibits a rectangular sofa shape more distinctly, though the round stool is not clearly visible.
   - The right one is better in terms of representing the sofa.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Displays strange body formations and an unclear structure, making it less plausible as furniture.
   - The right one: Looks more coherent with a solid sofa form, making it more plausible.
   - The right one is better as it appears more normal and solid.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: The texture is less refined and lacks detail.
   - The right one: Shows more realistic and detailed textures, especially on the sofa fabric.
   - The right one is better for texture detail and realism.
