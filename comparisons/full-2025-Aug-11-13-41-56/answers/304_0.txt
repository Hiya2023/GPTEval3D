Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has an irregular, unsymmetrical structure with visible books. It doesn't clearly resemble a traditional bookshelf.
   - The right object has a more rectangular and traditional bookshelf shape with distinguishable shelves and books.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears irregular and fragmented, lacking clear solid structure.
   - The right object looks more cohesive and plausible as a solid piece of furniture.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's textures appear less detailed and somewhat noisy.
   - The right object's textures are sharper and more defined.
   - The right one is better.
