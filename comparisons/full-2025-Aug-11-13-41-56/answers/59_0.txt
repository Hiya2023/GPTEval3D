Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one closely resembles a "cubic ottoman" with a defined cubic shape and appropriate proportions. The right one has a more cushion-like texture but deviates from a cubic shape. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and cubic in structure, consistent with the prompt. The right one has visible surface irregularities and a less defined shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one maintains a consistent texture that aligns with its cubic shape. The right one shows mismatched texturing with geometric distortions.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has smoother textures that suit the intended look of an ottoman, whereas the right one appears noisier and less refined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows a clearer geometry with crisp edges suitable for a cubic shape. The right one displays distortions and inconsistent details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left model better aligns with the prompt, appears more plausible, and is more refined in geometry and texture.
The left one is better.
