Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one accurately depicts a triangular road sign with defined edges and a standard shape.
   - The right one has more of a diamond shape and does not align with the triangular description.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a consistent structure and reasonable proportions for a road sign.
   - The right one appears less plausible with distorted forms and unclear proportions.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows better alignment between texture and geometry, maintaining the triangular form.
   - The right one lacks clear alignment, with texture distorting the shape.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one captures fine details without blurring, showcasing clear textures.
   - The right one appears noisier and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has more organized and pleasing geometry.
   - The right one shows disorganized and noisy geometric details.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   The left one consistently outperforms in all criteria, showing a clear advantage.
   The left one is better.
