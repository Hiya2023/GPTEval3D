Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a floral texture but is irregular and not very round, which does not completely match the description of "a round cushion."
   - The right object is more uniformly round and cushion-like, aligning better with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears irregular and less cushion-like, possibly due to its uneven shape.
   - The right object looks solid with a clear, consistent shape that resembles a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a detailed floral print with vibrant colors, suggesting higher texture detail.
   - The right object has a simpler pattern and less textural detail.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
