Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a cubic shape with a texture that resembles fabric, aligning well with the term "cubic ottoman."
   - The right one has a textured pattern but does not distinctly represent a cubic shape, making it less aligned with "cubic ottoman."
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more solid and plausible as a single, cohesive 3D object.
   - The right one looks less coherent with its multicolored texture and less defined structure.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has a more uniform texture that is less detailed but coherent.
   - The right one has more vibrant colors and a busier texture but is not very sharp or realistic.
   The left one is better.
