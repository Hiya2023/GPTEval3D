Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears spherical with a cubic base, aligning closely with the prompt "A spherical globe on a cubic pedestal."
   - The right object has a spherical form with distinct Earth-like textures but lacks a visible cubic pedestal. 
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and consistent, although somewhat abstract in texture.
   - The right object displays more detailed features but has irregular and noisy structures that detract from its plausibility.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a smooth and less detailed texture.
   - The right object shows a sharp, detailed Earth texture with vibrant colors, despite the noise.
   - The right one is better.
