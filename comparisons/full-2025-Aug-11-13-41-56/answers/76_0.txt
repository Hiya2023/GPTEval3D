Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model appears as a round cushion, consistent with the text prompt. The right model has a floral texture and irregular shape, not aligning well with the "round cushion" description.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model looks natural and solid with realistic proportions. The right model has irregular and duplicated parts that make it implausible.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture matches the cushion shape. The right model's texture does not match the irregular geometry well.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has clear texture details that align with the cushion appearance. The right model has overly busy and abstract textures.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits a smooth and well-organized structure. The right model shows noisy and disorganized geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left model better fulfills the criteria of appearance, plausibility, and details, according to the prompt.
The left one is better.
