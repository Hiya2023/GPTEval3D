Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be more rectangular than hexagonal. There is no clear triangular frame visible.
   - The right object more closely resembles a hexagon but lacks a distinct triangular frame.
   
The left one does not align well with the text prompt, while the right one somewhat matches the hexagonal aspect but misses the triangular frame.

Final answer:
2 (Right one is better)
