Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a red triangle, which might loosely resemble a traffic cone, but there's no evident circular ball present. 
   - The right object has a more recognizable traffic cone shape with distinct colors suitable for a traffic cone, but also lacks a circular ball.
   - Both models fail to include the circular ball, but the right one better represents the traffic cone.

Final answer:
2 (The right object is better.)
