Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear conical lampshade and a distinguishable cylindrical base, aligning well with the text prompt "A conical lampshade on a cylindrical base."
   - The right one appears to have a less distinguishable conical shape and the base is not evident or cylindrical.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows a coherent structure with a clear separation between the lampshade and the base, making it appear plausible as a solid object.
   - The right one seems to have more noise with less clear structural separation, and it lacks a defined base.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has simpler textures that align well with a typical lamp design, though they are not highly detailed.
   - The right one has more detailed and colorful textures, though it may detract from the realistic representation of a lamp.
   - The right one is better.
