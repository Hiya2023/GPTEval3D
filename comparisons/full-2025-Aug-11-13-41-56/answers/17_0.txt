Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears triangular, accurately reflecting the "triangular road sign" prompt. The right one appears more like a diamond shape, which doesn't align with the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more natural appearance with appropriate proportions for a road sign. The right one has an unusual shape and less natural proportions.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture aligns well with the triangular shape, while the right one's texture is inconsistent with its overall shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures more defined textures that align with the concept of a road sign. The right oneâ€™s textures appear more abstract and unclear.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's geometry is cleaner and more representative of a triangular sign. The right one has less organized geometry with noticeable noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one better aligns with the prompt, appears more plausible, and has superior texture and geometry details.
The left one is better.
