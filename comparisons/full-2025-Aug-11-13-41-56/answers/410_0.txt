Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one resembles a textured spherical object but lacks distinct cushion-like features.
   - The right one resembles a round, cushion-like structure with a clear pattern that could be seen on fabric.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems solid and maintains a uniform shape without apparent structural issues.
   - The right one appears more structured with detailed surface patterns, enhancing its plausibility as a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a generally smooth texture with minor details.
   - The right one contains sharper patterns and more variation in texture, making it appear more detailed and realistic.
   - The right one is better.
