Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears more spherical and resembles a typical doorknob shape.
   - The right model has multiple layers and intricate designs, which might deviate from a simple spherical shape.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks solid and plausible as a doorknob with smooth, continuous surfaces.
   - The right model seems complex with potential redundancies, making it less plausible as a doorknob.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows smoother textures with reflections typical of metallic surfaces.
   - The right model has more detailed textures, but they may appear noisy.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
