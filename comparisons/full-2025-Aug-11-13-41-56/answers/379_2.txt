Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left model appears to have a basic rectangular shape with legs, but doesn’t clearly depict a square shape.
   - The right model has a more defined square shape consistent with the prompt "A square coffee table."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks less solid, with potential issues in the consistency of the shape, particularly the legs.
   - The right model looks more structurally plausible and solid with well-defined legs and top surface.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model’s texture seems blurry and lacks details.
   - The right model has sharper and more realistic textures, showing a clearer wood pattern.
   - The right one is better.
