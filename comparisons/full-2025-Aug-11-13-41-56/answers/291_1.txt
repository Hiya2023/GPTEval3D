Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - **Left (object 1):** The object has a triangular shape, but the edges do not appear clearly rounded. The texture seems consistent but doesn't emphasize the roundness.
   - **Right (object 2):** The object maintains a triangular structure and appears to have more rounded edges, aligning better with the "round edges" part of the prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
