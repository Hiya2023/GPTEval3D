Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left (object 1) has a hexagonal table but the mirror shape doesn't appear clear, and its alignment with the table is unclear.
   - The right (object 2) is clearly a hexagonal table with a round shape component which aligns better with the concept of a round mirror.
   - **Right (object 2) is better.**

2. **3D Plausibility**: 
   - The left (object 1) appears somewhat distorted with strange structures and less plausible geometry.
   - The right (object 2) has a more consistent and solid structure, with a clear distinction between the table and the mirror.
   - **Right (object 2) is better.**

3. **Low-Level Texture**: 
   - The left (object 1) has textures that are less clear and more muddled.
   - The right (object 2) displays sharper and more detailed textures on both the table and mirror components.
   - **Right (object 2) is better.**

Final answer:
