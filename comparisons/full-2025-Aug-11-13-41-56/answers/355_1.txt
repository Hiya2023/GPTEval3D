Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - Left: The object has a circular seat and a round base, which do not fit the "square base" described in the prompt.
   - Right: The object also has a circular top and base, lacking the square base as described.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: The model looks solid and there are no visible strange or duplicated parts.
   - Right: The texture appears rough and may indicate noise or less refinement in structure.
   - Left is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - Left: The texture is smoother and more refined with less detail.
   - Right: The texture is more detailed but might appear overly rough or noisy.
   - Right is better.

Final answer:
