Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object resembles more of an intricately designed table rather than a simple square coffee table.
   - The right object better aligns with the prompt, as it represents a straightforward square coffee table.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object has irregularities and does not appear solid or natural for a coffee table.
   - The right object has proper proportions and looks like a real coffee table.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object has misaligned textures and geometry, with a mismatch in structure.
   - The right object shows better alignment, with textures fitting the geometry properly.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object has noisy and unclear texture details.
   - The right object captures textures neatly and clearly.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has noisy geometry without clear detail.
   - The right object has organized geometry and smooth details.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the right object better meets all requirements.
   - The right one is better.
