Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be an elliptical coffee table with several legs, but the circularity of the legs is not clearly visible.
   - The right model matches the description better with a clearly elliptical top and circular legs.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks solid and consistent in structure, with no evident issues.
   - The right model is well-formed but exhibits some unusual texture artifacts.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left modelâ€™s textures seem less distinct and somewhat fuzzy.
   - The right model has sharper and more detailed textures, especially noticeable on the legs.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
