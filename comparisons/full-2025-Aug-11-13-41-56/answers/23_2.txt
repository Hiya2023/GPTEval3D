Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model shows a rectangular sofa with an oval mirror beside it, accurately reflecting the text prompt.
   - The right model appears more ornate and does not match the description well.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears structurally plausible with reasonable proportions.
   - The right model has irregularities and looks less realistic.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model’s texture aligns well with its geometry.
   - The right model’s texture and geometry are mismatched and abstract.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model has clearer, more realistic texture details.
   - The right model's textures are overly stylized and abstract.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model presents smooth and coherent geometry details.
   - The right model's geometry is noisy and disorganized.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the left model better reflects the requirements.
   - The left one is better.
