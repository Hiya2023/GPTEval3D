Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one is a rectangular shelf with straight edges.
   - The right one is triangular and has rounder edges, aligning more closely with the description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is well-proportioned but not triangular.
   - The right one appears more natural and solid, fitting the triangular description.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one's textures and geometry align well but are not triangular.
   - The right one's textures align well with a triangular shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has clear textures, but they don't match a triangular shelf.
   - The right one has detailed textures that fit the shape.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has detailed geometry but not a triangular shape.
   - The right one has well-organized triangular geometry.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one aligns better with the prompt and criteria.
   - The right one is better.
