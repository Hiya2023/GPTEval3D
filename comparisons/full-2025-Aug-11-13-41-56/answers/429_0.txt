Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts a triangular shape with a ball situated inside it, resembling a cone on its side.
   - The right one shows a rounder shape, resembling a cone.
   - The left one corresponds better to the text prompt "A triangular traffic cone beside a circular ball."

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears solid and plausible with distinct triangular and spherical shapes, but the sphere's position seems unusual.
   - The right one has a more cohesive shape and appears more cone-like, but lacks distinction between cone and ball.
   - I cannot decide which is more plausible as both have strengths and weaknesses.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has visible textures, although they are not very detailed.
   - The right one has sharper and more colorful textures.
   - The right one is better in terms of texture details.
