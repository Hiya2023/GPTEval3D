Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a floral and colorful design, which is not entirely aligned with "a round cushion."
   - The right one is a simple round, plush object, closely matching the description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have complex, plant-like features that do not pursue the typical structure for a cushion.
   - The right one is a plausible, solid round shape typical for a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has varied, colorful textures but lacks sharpness and definition.
   - The right one has a consistently sharp and detailed texture more characteristic of a cushion.
   - The right one is better.
