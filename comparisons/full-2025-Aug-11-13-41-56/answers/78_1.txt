Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one struggles to represent a stool and sofa distinctly; The right one shows a clear distinction between a round stool and a rectangular sofa.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks a natural appearance, with unrealistic shapes; The right one provides more plausible structures for a stool and sofa.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one does not show effective alignment between geometry and texture; The right one exhibits better alignment between textures and corresponding shapes.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays inconsistent and unclear texture details; The right one captures clearer and more consistent texture details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has disorganized geometry; The right one presents a smoother, more organized geometry with less noise.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better adheres to the prompt, plausibility, alignment, and detail capture.
The right one is better.
