Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a conical shape for the lampshade but the base appears less cylindrical and more rounded.
   - The right one has a conical lampshade on a clearly cylindrical base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one shows some strange artifacts, especially on the base, which looks less plausible.
   - The right one appears more solid and coherent as a 3D model, with no apparent strange duplications or noise.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has bright and varied colors but lacks realistic details and sharpness.
   - The right one has a more realistic texture with better details, especially in the wood of the base.
   - The right one is better.
