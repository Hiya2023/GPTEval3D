I'm unable to view the images. However, I can help guide you through the analysis based on the criteria provided.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Describe the shape and features, such as whether it resembles a cylindrical bin and a rectangular desk. Evaluate if the objects are distinct and identifiable.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, describe if it matches a cylindrical bin and a rectangular desk. Check if both objects are present and distinct.
   - **Comparison:** Decide which side aligns better with the text description of "A cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk."

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Consider the solidity and normalcy of the shapes. Look for any strange, duplicated, or overly noisy structures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Again, evaluate the plausibility and solidity of the 3D form, noting any irregularities.
   - **Comparison:** Determine which model seems more plausible as a physical object.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Examine the details, sharpness, and realism of textures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Do the same evaluation for this model.
   - **Comparison:** Choose which side has better, more detailed textures.

### Final Decision:

Once you've completed the analysis:

- Summarize your decisions for each criterion using the options: 1 (left is better), 2 (right is better), or 3 (cannot decide). 
- Format your final answer accordingly: "x x x" (e.g., 1 2 2).

Feel free to share your observations, and I'll assist with any remaining guidance you need!
