Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model is a triangular sign, which matches the prompt "A triangular road sign."
   - The right model is a rectangular directional sign, which does not align with the triangular description.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears slightly uneven but is a plausible solid triangular shape.
   - The right model has a clear shape and is more structurally defined.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model's texture is rough and varied, with noticeable color details.
   - The right model has more defined text and a clearer surface texture.
   - The right one is better.
