Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one seems to focus more on the sofa feature, but lacks presence of the mirror; the right one includes both the sofa and the oval mirror clearly.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one lacks detail and real-world accuracy; the right one has a more natural appearance and proportions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture does not align well with the geometry; the right one shows better alignment between texture and geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears blurrier and less detailed; the right one has more refined texture details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks intricate geometry detail; the right one exhibits more organized and efficient geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model reflects the text prompt better, has more plausibility, and better aligns its geometry and texture.
The right one is better.
