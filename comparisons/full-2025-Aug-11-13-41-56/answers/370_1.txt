Analysis:
1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one appears to have a more defined structure with visible legs and a flat top typical of a square coffee table. The right one is also square but lacks clear definition in the legs and overall structure. The left one better aligns with the text prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one shows a more coherent and solid structure, with clearer, distinct legs and a solid top. The right one appears less defined, with a more ambiguous form. The left one is more plausible.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has sharper and more detailed textures, with visible wood grain and reflections. The right one seems less detailed and more blurred. The left one has better texture quality.

Final answer:
