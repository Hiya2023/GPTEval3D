Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a triangular shape and includes a circular element, aligning with the "triangular traffic cone beside a circular ball."
   - The right one correctly shows a traffic cone but lacks the ball.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems less natural with unrealistic shapes and features.
   - The right one appears more like a typical traffic cone.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one displays some misalignment in texture and geometry.
   - The right one shows better alignment between the cone's texture and shape.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has textures that look noisy and less realistic.
   - The right one has clearer, more realistic textures.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one shows some intricate details but appears overly noisy.
   - The right one has a more organized and realistic structure.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right one captures the form and realism of a traffic cone more effectively.
   - The right one is better.
