Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one resembles a cylindrical shape with distinct vertical lines, aligning with the description of a "cylindrical bin."
   - The right one has a flat, horizontal surface supported by legs, similar to a "rectangular desk."
   - Both objects align well with the text prompt.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears as a solid cylindrical structure with distinguishable textures and no obvious structural issues.
   - The right one displays a realistic desk shape with clear support structure.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows detailed texture patterns in the RGB images with visible outlines.
   - The right one presents textures that are also sharp and colorful, though slightly less detailed.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
