Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to have a cubic shape and resembles an ottoman with visible legs.
   - The right object also has a cubic form with a tufted texture on top, aligning with the ottoman description.
   - The left one is better as it visibly showcases the cubic shape more clearly.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and plausible with distinct textures.
   - The right object has a tufted appearance but appears less defined in structure.
   - The left one is better due to its clearer, more realistic structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has visible textures on the fabric and legs, though slightly blurred.
   - The right object shows textural details like tufting but in a darker, less clear manner.
   - Cannot decide, as both have their strengths in different textural aspects.
