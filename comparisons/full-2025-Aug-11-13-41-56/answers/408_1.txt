Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a green spherical object on top of a textured base, which does not clearly convey a lamp or a nightstand.
   - The right one has a golden spherical object on a round base, more closely resembling a lamp on a stand.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears inconsistent with unusual textures, making it less plausible as a stable structure.
   - The right one appears solid and cohesive, resembling a plausible lamp and stand.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has rough, unclear textures, lacking realism and detail.
   - The right one shows smoother, more realistic textures, with clearer details.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
