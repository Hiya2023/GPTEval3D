Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object accurately resembles a spherical doorknob, maintaining a smooth and simple shape. The right object has additional components and doesn't resemble a typical doorknob. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more natural and solid, with consistent proportions appropriate for a doorknob. The right object has irregular shapes and doesn't appear as plausible. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's texture aligns well with its spherical shape. The right object shows misalignment between texture and geometry, with textures not fitting the shapes. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object's textures are clean and appropriate for a doorknob. The right object's textures are chaotic and lack clarity. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's geometry is smooth and fitting for a doorknob. The right one has irregularities and unnecessary complexity. The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left object consistently aligns with the text prompt and displays better texture and geometry alignment. The left one is better.
