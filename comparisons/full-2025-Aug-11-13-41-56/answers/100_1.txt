Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has a cubic lamp shape with a curved base, corresponding better with the prompt.
   - The right model also somewhat aligns but looks more pointed and irregular.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more solid and proportionate.
   - The right model has irregular shapes and looks less natural.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model has smoother texture to geometry alignment.
   - The right model shows misalignment between textures and geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model captures clean textures without blurriness.
   - The right model looks noisy and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model shows a well-organized structure and smooth geometry.
   - The right model contains noise and inconsistent geometry.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all criteria, the left model aligns better with the prompt and has superior details and geometry.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
