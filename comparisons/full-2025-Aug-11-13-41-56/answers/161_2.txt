Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object correctly depicts a spherical lamp on a square base, aligning with the prompt. The right object does not match the description, as it shows a lamp with a shade and different base.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object looks coherent and plausible with proper proportions. The right object appears unrealistic due to its complex and inconsistent structure.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left object align well with its geometry, while the right object has misaligned textures that don't match the structure.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures fine details without blurriness, whereas the right object appears overly complex and lacks clarity.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits organized and smooth geometry, while the right one has chaotic and less defined geometry.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object accurately represents the prompt and has better texture and geometry consistency.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
