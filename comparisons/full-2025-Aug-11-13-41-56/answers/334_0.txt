Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one generally has a spherical shape with a base, resembling a doorknob, but the details are a bit distorted or unclear.
   - The right one also fits the doorknob shape with a spherical form and a clear base attachment.
   - The right one is better as it more clearly aligns with the prompt's description.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has some strange texturing and areas that seem noisy or distorted.
   - The right one appears solid and well-formed, with a realistic structure.
   - The right one is better due to its more plausible and coherent 3D structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a noisy texture with unclear details.
   - The right one has sharper, more consistent, and realistic textures.
   - The right one is better as it provides a more detailed and clearer texture representation.

Final answer:
