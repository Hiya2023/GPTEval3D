Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be more of a simple sphere, lacking features typical of a doorknob.
   - The right one includes details such as a base and fitting, resembling a doorknob.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks like a plausible spherical object, but does not have doorknob features.
   - The right one has a proper doorknob structure with mounting, appearing more realistic.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left texture is smooth but lacks detail, looking reflective like a sphere.
   - The right texture is more detailed with doorknob characteristics, though some areas are a bit noisy.
   - The right one is better.
