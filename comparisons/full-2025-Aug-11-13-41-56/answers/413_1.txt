Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a quadrilateral road sign with some text and graphics. It includes various elements and colors, which deviate from the prompt of "a triangular road sign."
   - The right one is a red triangular road sign, closely aligning with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems more complex with additional structures which could cause confusion or appear less plausible as a simple road sign.
   - The right one appears solid, simple, and clear as a triangular road sign.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed textures, including wood and clear text, although it's cluttered.
   - The right one has less detailed textures but is uniformly colored and simpler.
   - The left one is better.
