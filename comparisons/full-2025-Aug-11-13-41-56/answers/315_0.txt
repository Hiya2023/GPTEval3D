Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - Left (Object 1): The left object appears to have an abstract, organic form. It does not clearly resemble either a circular clock or a cuboid bookshelf.
   - Right (Object 2): The right object resembles a circular form that could be interpreted as a clock; however, the shelf aspect is not evident.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - Left (Object 1): The shape is irregular and abstract, lacking a definite structure, which makes it look more like an amorphous mass than a plausible object.
   - Right (Object 2): The structure is circular and solid, resembling a clock more closely although details might be exaggerated.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - Left (Object 1): The textures appear noisy and lack distinct details, contributing to its abstract look.
   - Right (Object 2): The textures provide some clarity, with a more defined and colorful appearance.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
