Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a hexagonal shape with minimal framing, aligning with "a hexagonal mirror" but lacks a triangular frame.
   - The right one displays a triangular frame but does not clearly show a hexagonal mirror shape.
   - The left one is better in terms of matching the prompt description of a hexagonal mirror.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is solid and has a coherent shape, with no noticeable duplication or strange structures.
   - The right one appears to have some coherence issues, where the triangular frame is clearer, but the hexagonal aspect is missing, resulting in a less plausible object.
   - The left one is better as it maintains a more consistent and plausible 3D structure.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has relatively smooth textures, but they lack detail.
   - The right one shows more texture detail and sharpness, especially noticeable on the frame.
   - The right one is better regarding texture realism and detail.
