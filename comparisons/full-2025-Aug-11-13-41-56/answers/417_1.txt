Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one looks like a sofa shape but lacks the presence of an oval mirror.
   - The right one appears to resemble a sofa more accurately, though details about the oval mirror are also missing.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one seems to have a more consistent and solid structure with less distortion.
   - The right one shows some irregularities that affect the solidity and plausibility.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has sharper and more detailed textures on the sofa, giving a more realistic appearance.
   - The right one appears to have less detailed and slightly blurry textures.
