Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (Object 1): Features a circular seat but lacks a square base; the base appears to be linear and lacks any pronounced square shape.
   - Right (Object 2): Has a circular seat and a base that is more rounded, potentially capturing the intended circular aspect of the seat but still lacks a square base.

The right one captures the circular aspect better but neither captures a square base adequately.

Final answer:
2
