Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) is abstract and does not clearly represent the specified objects "a rectangular laptop beside a circular mousepad." Instead, it shows a more complex, organic form without distinct features of a laptop or mousepad.
   - The right one (object 2) distinctly shows a laptop and a mousepad, with the laptop having a recognizable keyboard and screen, and the mousepad depicted as circular. This aligns more accurately with the text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
