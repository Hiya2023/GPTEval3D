Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one seems to lack a complete spherical globe and cubic pedestal structure, appearing disjointed.
   - The right one has a clear spherical globe on what appears to be a supporting structure resembling a pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks solidity and does not form a complete or plausible 3D structure.
   - The right one appears solid and coherent, forming a recognizable globe on a pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has unclear and incomplete textures, lacking in detail.
   - The right one shows sharper, more detailed textures that resemble a globe.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
