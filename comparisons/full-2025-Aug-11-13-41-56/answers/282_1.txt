Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- **Left (Object 1):** The object appears to be a spherical lamp on a square base. The nightstand is visibly square, matching the description closely. The lamp also has a textured surface that may suggest a lit effect.

- **Right (Object 2):** The object is spherical but appears more reflective rather than lamp-like. The base is not clearly discernible as a square nightstand. The atmospheric effects obscure details and do not align well with the prompt.

The left one is better.
