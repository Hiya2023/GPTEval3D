Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **The left one** has a more organic and uneven structure with no clear triangular shape or round edges.
   - **The right one** clearly exhibits a triangular shape with visibly round edges, more in line with the description.
   - **The right one is better**.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **The left one** appears disjointed and chaotic, lacking a coherent solid form.
   - **The right one** manifests as a consistent, structured, and plausible triangular shelf.
   - **The right one is better**.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **The left one** has a complex texture, but it appears noisy and lacks definition.
   - **The right one** has a sharper, cleaner texture that enhances the 3D shape.
   - **The right one is better**.
