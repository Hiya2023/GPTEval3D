Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears complex with irregular shapes and lacks clear triangular forms.
   - The right one clearly resembles a triangular shape with smooth edges, aligning well with "a triangular shelf with round edges."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one seems chaotic and lacks a coherent structure, making it less plausible.
   - The right one looks stable, solid, and consistent with a recognizable triangular shelf form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more textured appearance but lacks clarity and detail.
   - The right one has smoother and clearer textures, giving a more realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
