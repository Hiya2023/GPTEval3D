Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a cubic lamp with a clear curved base, aligning well with the text prompt. 
   - The right one is less distinct, with a less obvious cubic shape and base.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks more solid and with a clear cubic and curved base structure.
   - The right model seems less defined, with unclear features and possibly some noise.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one shows sharper and more detailed textures in the RGB images.
   - The right one appears more blurred and lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
