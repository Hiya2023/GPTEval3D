Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object is a triangular structure with some roundness to its edges. The right object is also triangular but less aligned with a shelf structure. The left one is better at representing a "triangular shelf with round edges."

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more solid and shelf-like, while the right object has less structural plausibility. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The textures on the left object align well with its geometry, while the right object shows less coherence. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has clearer texture details that fit a wooden, realistic aesthetic. The right one appears less detailed. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits more well-defined details and structure without noise. The right one is less detailed. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object is more aligned with the prompt, plausible, and detailed. The left one is better.
