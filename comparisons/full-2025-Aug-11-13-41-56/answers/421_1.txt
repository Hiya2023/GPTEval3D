Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one contains diamond-shaped signs on a pole with various symbols and text, which is less aligned with a "triangular road sign." The right one features a clear triangular shape, which fits the description better. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more complex with added elements that may not seem normal for a road sign, while the right one is straightforward and lacks strange structures or duplicated parts. 
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has detailed textures with clear symbols and text, while the right one has a simpler texture. The left one seems sharper and more detailed. 
The left one is better.
