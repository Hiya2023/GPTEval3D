## Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment:** 
   - *Left (Object 1):* The left object has a more intricate design with carved legs, which isn't specified in the prompt for a "square coffee table."
   - *Right (Object 2):* The right object is simple, straightforward, and aligns more closely with the description of a "square coffee table."
   - **The right one is better.**

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - *Left (Object 1):* The left model has ornate legs, which may appear less stable and plausible for a simple coffee table.
   - *Right (Object 2):* The right model has a solid, realistic structure typical of a square coffee table.
   - **The right one is better.**

3. **Geometry-Texture Alignment:**
   - *Left (Object 1):* The texture seems to follow the complex structure, but it might not align perfectly due to over-detailing.
   - *Right (Object 2):* The texture and geometry are well-aligned, showing a straightforward match between the texture and the simple shape.
   - **The right one is better.**

4. **Low-Level Texture Details:**
   - *Left (Object 1):* The textures are detailed but may appear inconsistent with the overall desired aesthetic.
   - *Right (Object 2):* The right model has clearer, more consistent textures appropriate for a coffee table.
   - **The right one is better.**

5. **Low-Level Geometry Details:**
   - *Left (Object 1):* The geometry is intricate, but might result in unnecessary complexity.
   - *Right (Object 2):* The geometry is simple and smooth, suiting the simplicity of the design.
   - **The right one is better.**

6. **Overall:**
   - Considering all criteria, the right model better matches the prompt and maintains simplicity and realism.
   - **The right one is better.**
