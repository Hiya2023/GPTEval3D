Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one clearly depicts a rectangular sofa. The mirror, however, is not easily identifiable.
   - The right one shows an object with less distinction between sofa and mirror.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has a more natural and recognizable sofa shape.
   - The right one appears more distorted and less realistic.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one has textures that align well with the shape of a sofa.
   - The right one has less alignment, with textures not aligning well with any real structure.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one maintains clear detail on the sofa.
   - The right one appears more abstract and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one shows smoother and well-organized geometry.
   - The right one lacks coherent geometry and appears noisy.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   The left one consistently performs better across all criteria.
