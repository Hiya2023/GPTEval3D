Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one (object 1) has a lamp with a spherical base but includes an additional lampshade, which is not mentioned in the text prompt. The alignment with a "spherical lamp on a square nightstand" is partial, as there is no visible nightstand.
   - The right one (object 2) is a spherical object on a flat surface that more closely resembles a stand or nightstand. It aligns more accurately with the description as it appears to be a straightforward spherical lamp on a platform.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
