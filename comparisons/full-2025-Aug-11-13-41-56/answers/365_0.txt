Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model features a spherical lamp on top of what resembles a square nightstand, fulfilling the attributes of a "spherical lamp on a square nightstand."
   - The right model shows a spherical object but lacks a clear representation of a nightstand.

   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more structured, with distinct parts: the lamp and the nightstand, giving a more convincing 3D look.
   - The right model seems less defined, possibly lacking solidity with a simplistic spherical shape and unclear base.

   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has textures that appear more detailed, particularly on the nightstand, showing variation and patterns.
   - The right model looks smoother with less textural detail.

   The left one is better.
