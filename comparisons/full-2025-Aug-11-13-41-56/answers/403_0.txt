Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a hexagonal mirror shape but lacks a clear triangular frame.
   - The right one also has a hexagonal mirror but includes a more distinct frame, albeit not explicitly triangular.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears integrated with the environment, which might not reflect a solid standalone object.
   - The right one presents a solid and plausible object without environmental integration.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed and sharp reflections of the environment.
   - The right one has a smoother, less detailed surface without complex reflections.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
