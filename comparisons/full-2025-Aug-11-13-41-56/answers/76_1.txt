Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one accurately depicts a simple round cushion as described.
   - The right one has floral patterns, deviating from the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks natural, smooth, and well-proportioned.
   - The right one appears fragmented and less cohesive.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one has a consistent texture and shape.
   - The right one's texture does not align well with its geometry due to added floral patterns.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one retains fine, simple texture details, fitting the aesthetic of a cushion.
   - The right one's texture is overly complex for the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one has smooth and well-organized shape.
   - The right one shows unnecessary complexity.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one better matches the prompt, with superior plausibility, alignment, and detail.
   - The left one is better.
