Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1):** Appears to have a colorful, patterned surface on a rectangular base. However, it lacks clear differentiation between a stool and a sofa.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Shows a light-colored, soft-looking object with more distinct separation between a rounded part (stool-like) and a longer part (sofa-like).
   - **Decision:** Right (Object 2) is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left (Object 1):** The model seems structurally questionable with indistinct shapes and potentially duplicated parts.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Appears more solid and plausible with recognizable furniture shapes and more coherent structure.
   - **Decision:** Right (Object 2) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (Object 1):** The texture is colorful but lacks clarity and realism.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Exhibits a more uniform and realistic texture, albeit subtle.
   - **Decision:** Right (Object 2) is better.

Final answer:
