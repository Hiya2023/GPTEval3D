Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a structure resembling a table with hexagonal features, aligning well with "a hexagonal table." However, there is no distinct round component identifiable as a mirror.
   - The right one also shows a hexagonal structure but lacks any indication of a round mirror as per the prompt.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid with a clearer structure and visible details, suggesting a more plausible 3D form.
   - The right one seems less defined and lacks structure, making it less convincing as a 3D model.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows some texture details and clarity on the surface, though not very sharp.
   - The right one lacks distinct texture, appearing more blurred and less detailed.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
