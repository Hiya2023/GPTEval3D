Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more distinct square shape and better represents a "square coffee table"; The right one also resembles a square coffee table but appears more abstract.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks solid and plausible as a table, with clear surfaces and legs; The right one has a less distinct form, affecting plausibility.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The texture on the left object adheres well to its geometry, maintaining the table's structure; On the right, textures and geometry are not as well aligned, leading to an abstract appearance.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures detailed wood grain texture well; The right one looks more blurred and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows organized geometry with clear tabletop and legs; The right one has more noise and lacks refined details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object consistently performs better in alignment, plausibility, and detail.
The left one is better.
