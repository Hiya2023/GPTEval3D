I'm unable to evaluate or compare the images you provided directly. However, I can guide you on how to assess these aspects based on the description you provided.

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Describe how well the spherical shape and flat seat are presented.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Describe how the spherical shape and flat seat are presented.
   - Decision: Determine which object better aligns with "A spherical chair with a flat seat."

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Look for solid, realistic appearance without strange parts.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Check for solidity and absence of strange or duplicated parts.
   - Decision: Decide which model appears more plausible as a 3D object.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Assess the sharpness, realism, and detail of textures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Examine the texture's sharpness, realism, and detail.
   - Decision: Determine which object has better texture quality.

### Final answer format:
- Use the options: `1` for the left object, `2` for the right object, `3` if you cannot decide.
- Example: `1 2 1`

Feel free to perform the evaluation using these guidelines!
