Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to be a rectangular sofa with soft, cushioned features. 
   - The right one also resembles a rectangular shape and looks more structured as a sofa.
   - Evaluation: Neither model clearly displays a round stool. Both models reflect a rectangular sofa, but the right one seems more consistent with the sofa description due to its structured appearance.
   - **The right one is better.**

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks solid and plausible as a sofa, though softer and potentially less structured.
   - The right one, despite its more structured look, appears to have some unnatural holes and irregularities within the design, making it less realistic as a solid piece.
   - **The left one is better.**

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows subtle red texture with a soft, cloth-like appearance, though slightly blurred.
   - The right one has sharper, wood-like textures but includes some visual noise and less uniformity.
   - **The right one is better.**
