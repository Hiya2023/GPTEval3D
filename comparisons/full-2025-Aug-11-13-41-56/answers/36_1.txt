Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a detailed table with legs, matching a typical coffee table, but not specifically square.
   - The right one is square but lacks detailed legs.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one looks more like a real table with proper support from the legs.
   - The right one lacks structural detail and feels less plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one shows a mismatch between the table top and texture.
   - The right one's texture aligns better with the simplistic geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one has more intricate textures but feels noisy.
   - The right one is simpler yet cleaner and less noisy.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one contains more detailed geometry with intricate elements.
   - The right one is simpler with minimal detail.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall: 
   - Considering alignment with the prompt and texture quality, the right one balances detail and simplicity better.
   - The right one is better.
