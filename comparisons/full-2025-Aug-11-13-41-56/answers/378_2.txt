Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears more like a round object with concentric patterns, not resembling a lamp or a cubic shape.
   - The right model resembles a lamp with a cubic form and a curved base.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks unusual and not like a solid object; it seems abstract with potential structural issues.
   - The right model appears more solid and plausible as a 3D object, with clear lamp features.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has visible textures, but they seem noisy and abstract.
   - The right model has more realistic and sharper textures, resembling a lamp.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
