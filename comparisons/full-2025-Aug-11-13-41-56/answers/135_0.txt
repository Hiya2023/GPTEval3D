Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model has a spherical shape but the seat is not clearly flat.
   - The right model has a more distinctly flat seat while maintaining a spherical outer shape.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more rounded and consistent with a chair's appearance but lacks clear definition in some views.
   - The right model is better defined and gives a solid impression overall.
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture does not clearly align with the geometry, especially in the seat area.
   - The right model shows better alignment between texture and geometry particularly for the seat and spherical parts.
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model seems to lack detail, appearing smooth and less defined.
   - The right model captures more detailed texture, making it more visually appealing.
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model's geometry lacks intricate detail, appearing somewhat flat.
   - The right model has more defined geometry, with clear structural details.
   The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all the criteria above, the right model consistently performs better across various aspects.
   The right one is better.
