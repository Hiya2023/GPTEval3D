Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a diamond shape rather than a clear triangular shape, which doesn't align well with the text prompt "A triangular road sign."
   - The right one has a clear triangular shape that corresponds better with the text prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has strange body problems and irregularities, with protrusions that appear odd for a sign.
   - The right one appears more solid, with a consistent structure typical of a road sign.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more visible details and sharpness, with textures that seem more realistic.
   - The right one has less detailed textures, appearing slightly less sharp.
   - The left one is better.
