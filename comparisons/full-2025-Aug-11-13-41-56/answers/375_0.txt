Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a clear rectangular shape with cylindrical armrests, closely aligning with the description.
   - The right object appears more abstract and does not clearly represent a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears solid and plausible as a 3D model of a sofa. It has a coherent structure without apparent anomalies.
   - The right object seems less coherent, with irregular shapes and textures that do not resemble a sofa structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object's texture appears smoother and more defined compared to the right, which has irregular and unclear textures.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
