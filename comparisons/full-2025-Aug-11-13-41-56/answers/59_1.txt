Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one closely resembles a cubic ottoman with a simple design; the right one appears more textured. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has realistic proportions and shapes, giving it a more natural look. The right seems less solid. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left aligns texture and geometry well, while the right shows more abnormalities. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has clearer, more consistent textures, while the right appears noisy. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has smoother, more defined geometry; the right shows irregularities. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one meets all criteria more effectively. The left one is better.
