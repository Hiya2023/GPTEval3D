Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more complex structure which doesn’t resemble a hexagonal mirror; the right one more accurately represents the hexagonal shape mentioned in the prompt. The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has unusual proportions for what is meant to be a mirror and doesn't look solid; the right one appears more plausible as a mirror in terms of shape. The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one’s textures and shapes are more chaotic; the right one shows better alignment with its hexagonal shape both in RGB and normal maps. The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has unclear and incoherent textures; the right one shows more clarity and consistency in its details, fitting the aesthetic of a mirror. The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows complex but unordered geometry; the right one displays cleaner and more organized geometry, suitable for representing a mirror. The right one is better.

6. Overall, based on the analyses above, the right one better satisfies all the criteria. The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 2 2 2 2
