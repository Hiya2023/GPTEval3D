Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one has a spherical object, but the pedestal is not distinctly cubic and lacks definition.
   - The right one clearly shows a spherical globe on a distinctly cubic pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a smooth and continuous surface, but the pedestal appears vague and undefined.
   - The right one appears more detailed and structured with clearer separation between the globe and pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother texture but lacks details.
   - The right one shows more intricate textures and sharper details, especially on the globe.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer: 2 2 2
