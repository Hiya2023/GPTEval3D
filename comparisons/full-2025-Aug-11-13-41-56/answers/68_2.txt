Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a clearer rectangular bookshelf structure; The right one has extra, unclear textures.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one maintains more natural proportions with a solid bookshelf appearance; The right one has distorted features.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one consistently aligns texture and structure; The right one has misaligned textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one displays more coherent textures; The right one appears noisy and unstructured.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one presents smoother and more organized geometry; The right one exhibits excessive noise.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one is better in accurately representing a rectangular bookshelf with clear, cohesive details.
