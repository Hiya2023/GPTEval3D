Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left one appears more closely aligned with the description of "a round cushion," as it has a smooth, rounded shape. The right one looks irregular and less like a cushion.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks like a solid and plausible 3D model with a realistic form. The right one seems to have strange textures and less plausible structure for a cushion.
The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left one has sharper, more realistic textures mimicking fabric details. The right one has a noisy and unrealistic texture.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1
