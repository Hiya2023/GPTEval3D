Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a square coffee table with distinct legs, matching the prompt well.
   - The right object is also a square coffee table but is less detailed and distinct.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid and well-structured as a table, with clearly defined legs.
   - The right object seems to lack clarity, appearing less solid and more abstract.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more detailed and sharper textures, especially noticeable in the wood grain.
   - The right object lacks clear texture details.
   - The left one is better.
