Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one features a textured surface with a vertical linear element suggesting a clock hand, somewhat aligning with the prompt's description of a circular clock. The lower cuboid shape resembles the bookshelf.
   - The right one shows clearer separation between a circular form (the clock) and a cuboid shape (the bookshelf), but lacks detailed texturing.

The right one is better for accurately reflecting the described elements.

Final answer:
2
