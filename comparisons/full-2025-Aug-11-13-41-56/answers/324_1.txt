Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a spherical shape with a flat-looking seat and distinct legs, aligning well with "a spherical chair with a flat seat."
   - The right model also appears spherical and has a flat seat, but the leg design is less clear.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks more solid and structured, with identifiable legs and no obvious structural issues.
   - The right model appears less detailed in the normal renderings, with potentially less definition in the structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model exhibits brighter and more defined textures, with noticeable details in the seat and leg areas.
   - The right model's texture appears less sharp and less defined.
   - The left one is better.
