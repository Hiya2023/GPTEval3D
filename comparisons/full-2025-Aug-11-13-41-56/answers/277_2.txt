Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (object 1): This object is a multi-tiered shelf with straight edges, not reflecting the round edges aspect of the prompt. It does not prominently feature a triangular shape as described.
   - Right (object 2): This object has a clear triangular shape, and the edges appear more rounded. It aligns more closely with the description of "a triangular shelf with round edges."

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
