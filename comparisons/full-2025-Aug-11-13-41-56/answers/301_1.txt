Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: This appears to have a round stool beside a rectangular sofa, both well-aligned with the text prompt.
   - The right one: Does not clearly depict a round stool or a rectangular sofa.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: The models look coherent, solid, and plausible with clear distinction between the stool and sofa.
   - The right one: The shapes are unclear, and the structures do not resemble a stool or sofa effectively.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Textures appear more detailed and realistic, particularly with visible cushions.
   - The right one: Textures are noisy and less distinct.
   - The left one is better.
