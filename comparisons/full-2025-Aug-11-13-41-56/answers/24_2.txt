Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model features a clear conical lampshade and a cylindrical base. The right model has a conical lampshade that appears more textured and sophisticated, while the base is also cylindrical but markedly more detailed. The right one captures both components as distinct and accurate.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model is simple and coherent with normal proportions. The right model has more intricate textures but maintains plausible proportions and structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model shows simple alignment between geometry and texture. The right model features more detailed textures that fit the lamp shape well.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model's textures are basic and lack detail. The right model exhibits rich textures, especially on the lampshade.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model has basic geometry, while the right model showcases intricate geometry, especially along the base and shade details.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, given the above analyses, the right model consistently exhibits better details and alignment with the text prompt.
The right one is better.
