Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one does not clearly depict a rectangular laptop or a circular mousepad.
   - The right one is similarly unclear and does not represent the text prompt effectively.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more solid and cohesive, although it lacks clear identifiable structures.
   - The right one has a lot of noise and fragmented parts, making it less plausible as a cohesive 3D model.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smoother and slightly more detailed texture, though still quite minimal.
   - The right one lacks discernible texture details and appears noisy.
   - Left (object 1) is better.

Final answer:
