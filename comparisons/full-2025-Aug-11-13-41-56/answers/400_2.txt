Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a cylindrical shape which aligns well with "a cylindrical bin."
   - The right model has a rectangular surface supported by a structure that resembles a desk.
   - Both models align well with the text prompt.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model is solid and consistent with a cylindrical form, with no obvious structural issues.
   - The right model has a realistic desk structure with no apparent issues.
   - Cannot decide.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left model's texture is colorful but lacks definition and crisp details.
   - The right model's texture, while also colorful, appears to have slightly more variation and detail in comparison.
   - Right (object 2) is better.

Final answer:
