Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 

- **Left (Object 1):** The model appears rectangular with smooth armrests, which could represent cylindrical shapes, but lacks additional clear cylindricity. The texture is plain and lacks detail.

- **Right (Object 2):** The model has a clear rectangular form with distinct cylindrical armrests and additional detailing on the surface. The texture and structure align more closely with the text prompt. 

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
