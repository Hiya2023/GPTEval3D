Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is fragmented and does not clearly represent a globe on a pedestal; the components appear disjointed and floating.
   - The right one clearly shows a globe on a pedestal with supporting structures.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks solidity and coherence, with disconnected parts and an unclear structure.
   - The right one has a solid, coherent structure that aligns with typical globe designs.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has vague textures with low detail and definition.
   - The right one displays sharper, more detailed textures on both the globe and pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
