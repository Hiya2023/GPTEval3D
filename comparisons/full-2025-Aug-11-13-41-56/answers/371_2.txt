Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more decorative, colorful appearance with a flower-like pattern on top, which does not closely resemble "a round cushion."
   - The right one has a simple, round shape that more accurately reflects the concept of "a round cushion."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have an uneven, complex top structure with potential duplications and an unclear overall form.
   - The right one has a consistent round form that appears more solid and realistic for a cushion.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has vibrant colors, but the texture appears less detailed and somewhat noisy.
   - The right one shows a more uniform, sharper texture that is typical of a fabric material.
   - The right one is better.
