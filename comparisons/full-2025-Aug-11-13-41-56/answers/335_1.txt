Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a somewhat triangular shape but looks more like an abstract sculpture rather than a road sign. 
   - The right one closely resembles a road sign with a clearly defined pole and signage, although it isnâ€™t triangular.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears abstract and not like a solid, realistic object. It has a strange surface and structural issues.
   - The right model looks more like a coherent 3D object with clear elements resembling parts of a road sign.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a rough texture that is not very detailed or realistic.
   - The right one has more recognizable details and textures resembling a road sign.
   - The right one is better.
