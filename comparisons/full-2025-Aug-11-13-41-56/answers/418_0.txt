Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears as a complete, filled bookshelf with books visible on the shelves. It aligns well with the concept of a "rectangular bookshelf."
   - The right model is more simplistic and lacks the detailed presence of books, but it maintains a rectangular bookshelf shape.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model, despite displaying more details, may appear overly complex and potentially has inconsistent proportions.
   - The right model presents a more cohesive and structured shape without abnormalities.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model shows more intricate textures with visible books and finer details.
   - The right model features less detailed textures, lacking the realistic appearance of the left model.
   - The left one is better.
