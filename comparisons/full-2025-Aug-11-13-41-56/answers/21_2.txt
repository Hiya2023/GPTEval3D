Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears as a rectangular shelf with flat edges; the right one reflects a triangular shape with rounded edges, as per the prompt.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility. The left one resembles a solid structure with regular proportions; the right one also has a plausible form and proportions.
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment. The left one’s texture seems consistent with its shape. The right one’s texture aligns well with its triangular geometry.
Cannot decide.

4. Low-Level Texture Details. The left one captures some wood-like textures; the right one displays clear and detailed textures consistent with a triangular form.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details. The left one has a simple structure without much detail; the right one exhibits more intricate edges and form.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better aligns with the text prompt and has finer texture and geometry details.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
2 3 3 2 2 2
