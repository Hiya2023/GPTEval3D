Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has an elliptical top but the legs are more tapered than circular; the right one has a more accurate leg shape with better circularity. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and natural; the right one has unnatural noise and distortions in shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows a smooth transition between texture and geometry; the right one exhibits misalignments with chaotic textures.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has simpler textures but avoids blurriness; the right one's textures are more detailed but chaotic.
Cannot decide.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays clearer geometry with fewer inconsistencies; the right one shows more noise and irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one is more consistent in terms of general shape and alignment despite less accurate leg shapes.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
2 1 1 3 1 1
