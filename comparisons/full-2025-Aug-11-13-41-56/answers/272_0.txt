Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one (Object 1) has an elliptical shape and distinct circular legs, which aligns well with the prompt description of "an elliptical coffee table with circular legs."
   - The right one (Object 2) also has an elliptical shape and features circular legs, fitting the text description accurately.

Both objects seem to meet the prompt requirements effectively, but the left one seems to better capture the clarity of the elliptical and circular aspects.

Final answer:
1. Left (object 1) is better.
