Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object looks like a hexagonal shape but doesn't depict a table or mirror. The right object resembles a hexagonal table with details under it, aligning more with the description. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears abstract and lacks solid structure, while the right object, though abstract, shows some depth and solidity. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures don't align well with the geometry, whereas the right object shows better alignment between texture and shape, appearing more cohesive. 
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has uniform and indistinct textures. The right object shows more variance and clear details in textures, enhancing realism.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object lacks clarity in geometry, appearing noisy. The right object exhibits structured geometry that better represents a 3D form. 
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right object better aligns with the prompt and demonstrates superior 3D structure and texture.
The right one is better.
