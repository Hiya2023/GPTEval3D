Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a trapezoidal shape that matches the description well; the right one appears more like a ladder than a bookshelf. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and maintains a consistent shape across views; the right one has uneven proportions. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has a good alignment between shape and texture, matching the trapezoidal structure. The right one's texture doesn't align well with the ladder-like geometry. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures the material texture more consistently; the right one seems more abstract and less defined. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one displays better-defined edges and surfaces; the right one has more irregular geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one accurately reflects the prompt and maintains better structural integrity. The left one is better.
