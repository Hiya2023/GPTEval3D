Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one (Object 1) appears to have a lampshade shape with a bulb inside and a curved base, resembling a typical lamp.
   - The right one (Object 2) appears to show a rough, less defined shape that may resemble a cube but lacks clear features.
   - Left (Object 1) is better, as it aligns more closely with "A cubic lamp with a curved base."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one (Object 1) shows a plausible lamp with a clear shape and structure, including a distinguishable base and shade.
   - The right one (Object 2) lacks a clear and coherent structure, appearing noisy and indistinct.
   - Left (Object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one (Object 1) has detailed textures, especially on the base and shade, indicating reflective surfaces and material differences.
   - The right one (Object 2) has vague and less defined textures.
   - Left (Object 1) is better.

Final answer:
