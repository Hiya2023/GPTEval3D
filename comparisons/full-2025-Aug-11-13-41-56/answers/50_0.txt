Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clearer hexagonal shape; the right one is less distinct and doesn't clearly show a triangular frame.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more solid and well-formed; the right one is less consistent in shape.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has better alignment between the RGB image and normal map; the right one shows inconsistencies.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures details more sharply; the right one appears blurrier.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a more organized structure; the right one seems less well-defined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model aligns better with the text prompt with a clearer structure and more consistent detail.
The left one is better.
