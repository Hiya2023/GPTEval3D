Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears as a textured cylindrical structure, but lacks the appearance of being beside a desk.
   - The right object is more simplified but also does not show a clear alignment with a desk.
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems structurally complex with textures that might indicate multiple layers or bands. It feels more solid but potentially too complicated.
   - The right object is simpler and has a cleaner cylindrical shape, making it appear more plausible as a single object.
   - Right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has varied textures but lacks clarity and sharpness.
   - The right object, despite its simplicity, appears to have a smoother and cleaner texture.
   - Right one is better.

Final answer:
