Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left: The shape is not clearly defined or rectangular; armrests are not distinct.
   - Right: Clear rectangular shape with visible cylindrical armrests.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - Left: Appears less structured with unclear form.
   - Right: More natural and solid with recognizable sofa features.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - Left: Texture does not match the confused geometry.
   - Right: Texture aligns well with the defined shape of the sofa.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - Left: Texture is muddled and lacks definition.
   - Right: Texture is clear and detailed, enhancing realism.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - Left: Geometry is noisy, with poorly defined shapes.
   - Right: Geometry is smoother and better represents a sofa's shape.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall: 
   - The right one better represents all criteria.
