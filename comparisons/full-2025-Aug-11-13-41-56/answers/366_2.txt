Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a simple spherical shape, which could align with "spherical," but lacks a definitive doorknob feature or structure.
   - The right one clearly depicts a spherical shape attached to a base, resembling a doorknob more accurately.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one is a basic sphere and does not exhibit any strange structures but also lacks additional features.
   - The right one appears more solid and plausible as a doorknob with a spherical knob and base, but some rendering artifacts are present.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a simpler texture with less detail and variation.
   - The right one shows more realistic texture detailing, especially in the base and knob, with richer color variations.
   - The right one is better.
