Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one: Contains a shape that isn't clearly a traffic cone or a ball; more of an abstract form.
   - The right one: Clearly displays a red triangular cone shape, similar to a traffic cone, but lacks the circular ball.

The right one is better at representing the cone, although it misses the ball described in the text prompt.

Final answer:
2
