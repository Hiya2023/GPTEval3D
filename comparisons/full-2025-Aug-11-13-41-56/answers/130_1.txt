Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clear cuboid form with a circular clock; The right one has a less distinct separation between clock and shelf.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has more defined shapes and realistic proportions; The right one looks distorted and less coherent.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one maintains a better alignment between texture and geometry, especially in the clock area; The right one has mismatched textures and shapes.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures clearer details in the textures; The right one appears blurry and lacks definition.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one retains more structured and consistent geometry; The right one shows noise and lack of detail.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one demonstrates superior alignment, texture, and geometry.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
1 1 1 1 1 1
