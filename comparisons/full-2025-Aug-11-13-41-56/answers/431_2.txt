Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is an oval table with simple, straight legs.
   - The right one is also an oval table but with a more ornate pedestal base.
   - The left one better corresponds to a typical dining table design.
   - Decision: Left (object 1) is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears solid with consistent legs and a top surface.
   - The right one has a more intricate design, but the base appears somewhat unstable for a dining table.
   - Decision: Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a more uniform texture but lacks detail.
   - The right one has a glossier finish with intricate patterns, although potentially unrealistic.
   - Decision: Right (object 2) is better.
