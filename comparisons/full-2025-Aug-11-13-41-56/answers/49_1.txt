Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a triangular shape aligning with the prompt, while the right one is rectangular. The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears more natural with a consistent triangular shape; the right one is poorly aligned and unclear. The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows better alignment between texture and geometry for a triangular sign; the right one does not. The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures the sign's details more clearly; the right one is vague. The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one's normal maps show clearer triangular structure; the right one lacks clear geometry. The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one accurately represents the text prompt and possesses more plausible 3D structure and alignment. The left one is better.

Final answer:
