Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a clearer hexagonal shape but lacks the triangular frame. The right one is also hexagonal and more closely resembles the specified triangular frame.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears consistent and solid. The right one has better-defined edges but displays slight irregularities in the frame.
Cannot decide.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows good alignment between color and shape. The right one has a more pronounced discrepancy between its hexagonal shape and frame texture.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures more consistent texture details, while the right one appears slightly blurred and less defined in some areas.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left normal map shows more intricate details, whereas the right normal map is less refined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, based on the criteria analyzed, the left model offers better geometry-texture alignment and low-level detail capture despite the right model's better initial prompt alignment.
The left one is better.
