Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more complex and ornate design with textures that don't fully align with a simple "square coffee table". The right one reflects a simple square table form more accurately. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears distorted with textures that don't match the shape well, making it less plausible. The right model has regular, geometric proportions and aligns better with the natural form of a square table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has mismatched textures and geometry, leading to an incoherent appearance. The right one shows consistent alignment between texture and shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has overly complex textures that seem noisy and not detailed. The right model's textures are simple and more in line with a typical table aesthetic.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model exhibits chaotic and noisy geometry, while the right model maintains a clean and organized structure consistent with a square table.
The right one is better.

6. Overall: Considering text alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometry, the right model consistently outperforms the left.
The right one is better.

Final answer:
