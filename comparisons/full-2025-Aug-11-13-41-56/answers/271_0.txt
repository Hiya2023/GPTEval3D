Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to depict only a rectangular sofa-like object, lacking the round stool mentioned in the prompt.
   - The right model shows two rectangular sofa-like objects but still lacks the round stool as described in the text prompt.

Both models fail to include the round stool, but the right model at least has multiple sofa-like objects, suggesting a partial alignment with the scene complexity implied by the prompt.

The right one is slightly better due to representing multiple objects.

Final answer:
2
