Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - The left one (object 1) has a lampshade with a cone-like shape but is placed on a non-cylindrical, more rounded base. The base does not match the "cylindrical" description.
   - The right one (object 2) consists of a more defined conical lampshade and a clear cylindrical base, aligning precisely with the text prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
