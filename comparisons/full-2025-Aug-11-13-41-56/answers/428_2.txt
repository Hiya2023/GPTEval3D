Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object appears to be a spherical shape on a pedestal, although the pedestal seems to deviate slightly from being cubic, with more of a rounded or ornate base.
   - The right object clearly resembles a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal, more closely aligning with the "cubic" aspect of the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks solid but has an unusual base shape that might not support the sphere well.
   - The right object has a clear, plausible shape with a defined pedestal and globe, appearing structurally sound.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has a more uniform texture with subtle color changes but lacks detailed features.
   - The right object displays more variation in texture, with distinct color patterns that emulate a globe more realistically.
   - The right one is better.
