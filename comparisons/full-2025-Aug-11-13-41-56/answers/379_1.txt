Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**: 
   - The left model appears to have a basic structure of a table, with four legs and a flat top, although the table seems more rectangular than square.
   - The right model also resembles a table with a flat top and legs, and it aligns better to the square shape mentioned in the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - The left model has less defined edges and appears to have an irregular structure, particularly in the legs, which affects its plausibility as a solid object.
   - The right model looks more uniform and has more consistent features, making it appear more stable and plausible as a 3D object.
   - The right one is better.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - The left model has a more blurred texture with less noticeable details.
   - The right model shows sharper textures and more detailed surface features, improving its realistic appearance.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
