Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: Left shows both a rectangular sofa and an oval mirror accurately. Right appears to have only a sofa without a visible mirror.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: Left's sofa and mirror look more solid and natural. Right's sofa has irregular shapes and looks less convincing.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: Left has a consistent alignment between texture and geometry. Right shows discrepancies between texture and geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: Left captures finer details without blurriness. Right appears abstract and less detailed.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: Left has more organized and smooth geometry. Right shows noisy and unstructured geometry.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one comprehensively fulfills the criteria better.
   The left one is better.
