Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more open and simple shelf design, which aligns less with the typical image of a bookshelf, as it seems more like a decorative piece.
   - The right one looks more like a traditional bookshelf, with identifiable rectangular shelves and a frame.
   
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one has irregular and inconsistent elements, such as round knobs and uneven surfaces.
   - The right one has a solid, plausible design with proper bookshelf proportions.
  
   The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left one shows textures that don’t align well with the geometry, making it look inconsistent.
   - The right one's textures align well with the bookshelf shape.
  
   The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left one’s texture lacks clarity and seems noisy.
   - The right one’s texture is clearer and represents wood grain suitable for a bookshelf. 
  
   The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left one has a confusing and noisy geometry.
   - The right one has more refined and stable geometric details. 
  
   The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all factors, the right one better represents a rectangular bookshelf with proper design and detailing.
   
   The right one is better.
