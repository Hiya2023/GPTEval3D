Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **Left (Object 1):** The model has a decorative pedestal base and round top, but it is more circular than oval.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The model has an oval shape with four solid legs, matching the dining table prompt more closely.
   - **The right one is better.**

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - **Left (Object 1):** The model has a realistic texture but appears more unstable and less plausible as a dining table.
   - **Right (Object 2):** The model appears structurally sound with realistic proportions of a dining table.
   - **The right one is better.**

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left (Object 1):** Texture is detailed with visible wood grain.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Texture is also detailed but slightly less sharp compared to the left one.
   - **The left one is better.**
