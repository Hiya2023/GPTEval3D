Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one presents a rectangular sofa with an oval mirror beside it, accurately reflecting the prompt. The right one shows a more abstract design that doesn't clearly match the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has realistic proportions for a sofa and mirror arrangement. The right one appears more stylized and less plausible as a real-world object.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model’s texture aligns well with its geometry, maintaining a realistic appearance. The right one has a mismatch between textures and geometry.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model captures fine details consistent with a sofa and mirror. The right model’s textures are overly abstract.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model shows well-organized geometry. The right one lacks coherent geometric details.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model is more aligned with the prompt, plausible, and detailed.
The left one is better.
