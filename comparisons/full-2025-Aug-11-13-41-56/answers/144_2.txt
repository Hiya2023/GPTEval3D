Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model captures more detail in the table structure but seems less square.
   - The right model shows a distinct square shape but appears too stylized.
   The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model has better proportions and seems more solid, though not perfectly square.
   - The right model's texture makes it look less plausible.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's texture aligns with the geometry, maintaining consistency across surfaces.
   - The right model has mismatched texture and geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model has richer textures, though a bit noisy.
   - The right model looks stylized but lacks detail.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model displays clearer geometric detail.
   - The right model lacks geometric clarity and smoothness.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, given the solidity, geometry, and texture alignment, the left model better embodies the criteria.
   The left one is better.
