Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left model has distinct legs and a decorated tabletop, but the top is not perfectly square; the right model has a square top with simpler legs.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model has more detailed leg designs but appears less stable; the right model looks more solid and plausible overall.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The textures on the left model are more detailed with variations on the legs and tabletop; the right model has less texture detail.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
2 2 1
