1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment:
   - Left (object 1): The object includes a circular element positioned above a colored cuboid structure, resembling a clock above a bookshelf.
   - Right (object 2): The image shows a circular element but lacks the detailed multicolored or bookshelf-like features as seen in object 1. It is more simplistic and abstract.

The left one is better.
