Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model features an oval top with thin, angled legs, resembling a simple dining table.
   - The right model has an ornate design with a central, carved pedestal base.
   - **Left (object 1) is better:** It aligns more closely with a straightforward interpretation of "an oval dining table."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears simple and structurally sound, with no visible issues.
   - The right model looks solid but might have more intricate details that need careful assessment.
   - **Left (object 1) is better:** It feels more like a typical, plausible table with clean lines.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a consistent but somewhat blurred texture, lacking fine details.
   - The right model offers more detailed and realistic textures, especially in the wood grain.
   - **Right (object 2) is better:** It provides a more detailed and aesthetically pleasing texture.
