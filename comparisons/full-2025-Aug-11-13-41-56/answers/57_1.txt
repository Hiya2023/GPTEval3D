Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object has a clearer square shape and looks more like a traditional square coffee table. The right object, while square, has more irregular features.  
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more structured and proportionate, resembling a solid table. The right object has more irregular and less plausible features for a table.  
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object has better alignment between texture and geometry, maintaining a consistent appearance. The right object shows misalignment with textures not fitting well.  
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object has more refined and less blurry textures, providing clearer detail. The right object's textures are less defined.  
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object maintains a coherent structure in its normal maps with fewer irregularities. The right object exhibits more irregular geometry with less clarity.  
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left object consistently performs better across all criteria, providing a more accurate, plausible, and detailed representation of a square coffee table.  
The left one is better.
