I'm unable to analyze the images directly, but I can guide you on how to evaluate them based on the given criteria. 

### Analysis:

1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Look for features like a spherical shape and determine if the seat appears flat. Evaluate how well it matches the concept of a "spherical chair with a flat seat."
   - **Right (Object 2):** Similarly, check for a spherical shape and a flat seat. See how closely this aligns with the prompt.

   Decide which matches the text prompt more closely.

2. **3D Plausibility:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Consider if it appears solid, with no strange body issues or duplicated/noisy parts when imagined as a 3D object.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Look for the same characteristics. Focus on whether the structure appears consistent and realistic.

   Determine which one is more plausible as a 3D object.

3. **Low-Level Texture:**
   - **Left (Object 1):** Examine the sharpness, realism, and detail of textures.
   - **Right (Object 2):** Evaluate textures in the same manner.

   Choose which has better texture quality.

### Final Answer:
Make your decision for each criterion, and summarize your final decision in the format specified (e.g., "1 2 2").
