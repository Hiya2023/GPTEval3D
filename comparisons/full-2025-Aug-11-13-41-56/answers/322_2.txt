Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model displays a sofa with an oval mirror directly above it, closely aligning with the description of "a rectangular sofa beside an oval mirror."
   - The right model shows a sofa without a visible mirror, missing part of the described elements.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid with distinct components that make sense spatially. The mirror and sofa structure seem plausible.
   - The right model is a bit less defined and appears to lack certain features that contribute to a clear 3D form.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has noticeable textural details on the sofa and more defined separation between the different elements.
   - The right model's texture appears more uniform and lacks detail.
   - The left one is better.
