Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & 3D Alignment**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: The object is a triangular sign, which aligns with the description "A triangular road sign." The texture and shape capture the essence of a road sign well.
   - **Right (object 2)**: This object is more rectangular with written text, which does not align with the triangular specification.
   - **The left one is better**.

2. **3D Plausibility**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: The model appears solid and plausible as a 3D object. The triangular shape is consistent and has no obvious structural anomalies.
   - **Right (object 2)**: While also solid, the shape is not triangular and does not align with what one expects of a triangular road sign.
   - **The left one is better**.

3. **Low-Level Texture**:
   - **Left (object 1)**: The texture is rough but cohesive, with vivid yellow details that are suitable for a road sign.
   - **Right (object 2)**: The texture appears more detailed with clear text and structure, though not fitting the description.
   - **The right one is better**.
