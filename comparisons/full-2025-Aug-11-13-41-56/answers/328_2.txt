Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to represent a blocky structure with colorful, abstract patterns, possibly resembling a sofa.
   - The right one seems to depict a more traditional wooden furniture piece, but it does not distinctly represent a stool or sofa.
   - The left one is better as it aligns more with the concept of a sofa from the prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears solid but lacks clear definition to identify specific parts like a stool or sofa.
   - The right one has structural issues with undefined and fragmented areas, making it less plausible.
   - The left one is better overall in terms of solid and plausible structure.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has vibrant and detailed textures but lacks clarity in application.
   - The right one has more uniform coloring, but less detail, looking more like a rough texture.
   - The left one is better as it offers more detailed textures.
