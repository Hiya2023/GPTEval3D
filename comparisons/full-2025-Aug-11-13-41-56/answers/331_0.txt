Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more rounded shape and does not fully resemble a cubic form.
   - The right one is more closely aligned with a cubic shape, conforming better to the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears to have more solid and visually consistent details, despite being less cubic.
   - The right model, while more cubic, seems less detailed in its 3D form.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left modelâ€™s texture appears sharper and more detailed, with a patchwork of colorful patterns.
   - The right model has less texture detail, appearing smoother and less realistic.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
