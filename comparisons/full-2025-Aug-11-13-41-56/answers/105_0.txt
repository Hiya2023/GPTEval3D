Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: The left model has a basic square form but lacks details; the right model is more detailed and better resembles a coffee table with defined legs and edges.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears less structured and more abstract; the right model has more defined proportions and structure, resembling a table.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model has less distinct alignment between texture and geometry; the right model shows better alignment with textures appropriately following the geometry.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model has less defined textures; the right model has sharper and more intricate textures, enhancing realism.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model displays more noise; the right model provides smoother and more organized geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model better fulfills the criteria, aligning well with the prompt and demonstrating superior texture, geometry, and structure.
The right one is better.
