Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left model is minimal and lacks detail, resembling a simple, cubic form.
   - The right model has a detailed texture and structure, with more alignment to "a cubic ottoman" in terms of realistic design.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears basic and lacks evident three-dimensional structure.
   - The right model shows more defined structures and appears solid and natural.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left model's geometry and texture appear mismatched and less refined.
   - The right model showcases better alignment between texture and geometry.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left model has very basic textures lacking intricacy.
   - The right model displays detailed textures that enhance realism.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left model lacks defined geometry and detail.
   - The right model has more intricate geometric details and smoothness.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right model consistently outperforms the left in all aspects.
   - The right one is better.
