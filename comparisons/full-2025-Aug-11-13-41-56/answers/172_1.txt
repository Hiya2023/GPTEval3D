Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has ornate legs and a glass-like top, not matching "a square coffee table". The right one is simpler, aligning more closely with the prompt.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has unusual, overly intricate legs, and disconnected elements. The right one has a more solid, realistic structure.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left oneâ€™s texture does not align well with its geometry, especially around the legs. The right one's texture is consistent with its shape.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has fuzzy details and lacks clarity. The right one exhibits clearer textures and finer details.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows unnecessary complexity without detail coherence. The right one has a clean and organized structure.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one better represents the prompt, is more plausible, and displays better texture and geometric alignment.
The right one is better.
