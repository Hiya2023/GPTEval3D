Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
The left one appears to have a more consistent square shape. 
The right one does not look as square-shaped due to perspective and lighting. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
The left one has some noise and irregularities, slightly affecting its plausibility. 
The right one appears more solid and natural. 
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
The left one's texture aligns with its geometry reasonably well. 
The right one's texture seems misaligned, with inconsistent coloring and shape. 
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
The left one has somewhat clear textures with visible details. 
The right one’s texture appears smoother but somewhat blurry. 
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
The left one shows some noisy details but captures essential features. 
The right one’s geometry is more consistent but lacks intricate details. 
The right one is better.

6. Overall, given the criteria considered, the left one aligns more closely with a square coffee table’s expected characteristics.
The left one is better.
