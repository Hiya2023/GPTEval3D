Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left object has a spherical shape but includes additional features that might resemble a doorknob stem or base.
   - The right object is spherical and appears more like a traditional doorknob without extra features.
   - The right one is better as it more closely aligns with "a spherical doorknob."

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object appears with additional structures, which could make it less plausible as a singular spherical doorknob.
   - The right object looks more cohesive and solid as a basic spherical form.
   - The right one is better for its simplicity and strong alignment to a plausible spherical form.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left object has more varied textures and colors, making it appear less uniform.
   - The right object has smoother, more consistent textures with a glossy appearance.
   - The right one is better for its sharp, realistic texture.
