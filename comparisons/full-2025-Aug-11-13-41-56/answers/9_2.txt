2. 3D Plausibility:
   - Left: Appears more natural and solid.
   - Right: Appears disproportionate with odd colors.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - Left: Texture aligns with geometry, more uniform.
   - Right: Texture does not align well; appears mismatched.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - Left: Captures more detail without appearing blurry.
   - Right: Appears less detailed and more abstract.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - Left: More organized and smooth geometry.
   - Right: Geometry is less defined and noisy.
   The left one is better.
