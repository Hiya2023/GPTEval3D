Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one shows a more spherical shape which aligns better with "round cushion," whereas the right one appears flatter. 
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left model appears more naturally rounded compared to the right model, which seems less cushion-like.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left model's texture follows the geometry more closely, with the floral patterns appearing more consistent with the shape.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left model displays more intricate and vivid details in the texture, while the right one seems simpler and less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left model captures more detailed and smoother geometric features, while the right displays more irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left model consistently performs better across criteria, showing a more accurate representation of a "round cushion."
The left one is better.
