Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: Appears to have a clear hexagonal shape which aligns well with the prompt, indicating a mirror. There's no visible triangular frame, though.
   - The right one: Also shows a hexagonal shape but seems more amorphous and doesnâ€™t clearly represent a mirror or a triangular frame.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: The shape is consistent across views and appears solid and normal for a hexagonal structure.
   - The right one: Looks irregular and less plausible as a coherent 3D model; the normals don't suggest a well-defined structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Shows sharp and detailed textures, suggesting a reflective mirror surface with environmental details.
   - The right one: Textures appear rough, lacking sharpness and detail.
   - The left one is better.
