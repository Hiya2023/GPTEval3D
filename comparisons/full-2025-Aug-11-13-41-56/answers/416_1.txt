Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: The left object depicts a more rectangular sign rather than triangular, which does not align well with the prompt. The right object is clearly triangular, which matches the description. 
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object has an irregular shape and seems more broken or patched together. The right object appears more solid and structured, resembling a typical triangular sign.
The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: The left object's texture appears rough and uneven, with some visible noise. The right object has sharper and clearer textures, providing more detail.
The right one is better.
