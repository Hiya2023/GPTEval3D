Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is blurred and does not clearly represent a hexagonal mirror; the right one appears clearer and more like a mirror.  
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears less solid and more blurred, while the right one exhibits clearer boundaries and proportions, resembling a plausible mirror.  
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows a poor alignment between texture and shape, whereas the right one has a better alignment between the RGB and normal maps.  
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The right object's texture is clearer and more defined compared to the left, which appears noisy and less detailed.  
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks organized structure and details. The right one displays a more coherent and detailed geometry.  
The right one is better.

6. Overall: The right 3D object performs better in all evaluation criteria.  
The right one is better.

Final answer: 2 2 2 2 2 2
