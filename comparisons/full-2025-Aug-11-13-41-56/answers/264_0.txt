Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - Left (Object 1): Features a rectangular sofa but lacks clear visibility of an oval mirror.
   - Right (Object 2): Displays an oval mirror but does not clearly present a rectangular sofa.

The left one better fulfills the "rectangular sofa" aspect, while the right one includes the mirror more clearly. Since the prompt specifies both items, each object fulfills one part but misses the other completely.

Final answer:
3 (Cannot decide)
