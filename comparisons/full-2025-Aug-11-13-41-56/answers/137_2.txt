Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one has a conical lampshade and a cylindrical base, matching the prompt accurately. 
   - The right one also shows a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base but is less clear due to additional textures and features.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left model looks simple and stable with a straightforward structure.
   - The right model has more complex shapes and textures but appears less stable and plausible.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left modelâ€™s texture aligns well with the simple geometry without much distortion.
   - The right model has textures that may not align perfectly with the base geometry.
   - The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left model features clear textures that match the aesthetic of a lamp.
   - The right model's textures appear more abstract and complex.
   - The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left model has smooth and clear geometry without noise.
   - The right model contains more intricate details but appears noisy.
   - The left one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The left one consistently interprets the prompt with clarity and plausibility across criteria.
   - The left one is better.
