Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a discernible rectangular sofa, but lacks an oval mirror; the right one includes both a rectangular sofa and an oval mirror.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one looks less integrated and has an unclear shape; the right one has a solid appearance with recognizable furniture elements.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one shows misaligned textures and shapes; the right one has coherent geometry and texture alignment for both sofa and mirror.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one appears blurry and lacks detail; the right one has clearer textures and distinct features.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows less detail in geometry; the right one exhibits more detailed and organized geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right model captures the text prompt better with a more plausible and detailed representation.
The right one is better.
