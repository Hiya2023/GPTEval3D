Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a spherical object with textures resembling a globe but lacks a cubic pedestal.
   - The right one features a spherical object on a cubic-like pedestal, more aligned with the prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to have normal globe textures but the structure is less clear in form and lacks a clear base.
   - The right one has a clearly defined sphere and pedestal, appearing more solid and plausible.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has detailed textures with recognizable globe features.
   - The right one has smoother, less detailed textures.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
