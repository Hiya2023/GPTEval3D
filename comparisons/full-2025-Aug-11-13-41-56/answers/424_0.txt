Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one appears to depict a cylindrical shape with additional textures and details but does not clearly show a desk.
   - The right one clearly shows a cylindrical shape but lacks any representation of a desk.
   - Both fail to fully represent “a cylindrical bin beside a rectangular desk.” Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more complex with additional textures, but may have unnecessary details; it seems less coherent and plausible.
   - The right one, although simpler, appears more solid and plausible as a cylindrical object.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has more intricate textures, potentially offering more detail.
   - The right one has simpler textures with less detail.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
