Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one resembles a vase more than a lamp, missing the distinct base, and the lampshade appears to be the main body. 
   - The right one has a clear conical lampshade and a cylindrical base that aligns well with the prompt "a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears as a singular object with floral patterns, lacking realistic solidity for a lamp.
   - The right one looks like a solid, plausible lamp with distinct parts (shade and base) and seems more coherent.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has vibrant floral textures, but they appear flat and less realistic.
   - The right one has a more realistic texture, with detailed shading on the lampshade and base, enhancing its believability.
   - The right one is better.
