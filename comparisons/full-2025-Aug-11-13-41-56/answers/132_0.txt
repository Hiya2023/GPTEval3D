Analysis:
1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one is cubic, resembling an ottoman; the right one appears more rounded and less defined.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has a more solid, cubic shape; the right one looks less structurally sound.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one aligns textures with its cubic shape; the right one shows some misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one captures texture details well without blurring; the right one looks less detailed.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has clear, sharp geometry; the right one appears less organized.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left one accurately reflects the text prompt and maintains high quality across all criteria.
The left one is better.

Final answer:
