Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one is a more traditional, solid bookshelf with books on its shelves, fitting the description of a "rectangular bookshelf" closely.
   - The right one is a simplified bookshelf with open and empty shelves, also rectangular but not as detailed.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears more stable and solid due to its traditional shape and filled shelves.
   - The right oneâ€™s structure looks somewhat unstable and less plausible as an actual bookshelf.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture: 
   - The left one has detailed textures with visible books, adding realism.
   - The right one lacks detail in texture, appearing more simplistic.
   - The left one is better.
