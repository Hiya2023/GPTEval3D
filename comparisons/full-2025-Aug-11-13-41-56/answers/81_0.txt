Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one has a more abstract triangular form but lacks round edges; the right one has a clear shelf form with round edges but is not triangular.
The left one is better for the triangular aspect, but neither aligns perfectly.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one appears abstract and less plausible as a shelf; the right one appears more natural and solid with proper shelf dimensions.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one has poor texture alignment with geometry appearing random; the right one shows aligned textures with the shelf structure.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has less coherent texturing; the right one shows clearer and more consistent texture detail.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one lacks clear details and has irregular shapes; the right one presents organized and smooth geometry.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, considering all aspects, the right model is more fully realized as a shelf even if it doesn't fully match the triangular prompt description.
The right one is better.
