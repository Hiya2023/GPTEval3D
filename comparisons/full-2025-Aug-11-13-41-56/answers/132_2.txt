Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one appears more cubic and matches the ottoman description better. The right one has a less defined cube shape.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has cleaner proportions, appearing more solid and plausible as a cubic ottoman. The right one seems slightly distorted.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one displays better matching between texture and geometry, with textures aligning well with the cubic shape. The right one shows misalignment.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one has more defined textures that capture the material details effectively. The right one's textures are less clear.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one has a smoother and more coherent geometry that aligns with the ottoman shape. The right one displays some irregularities.
The left one is better.

6. Overall, considering all criteria, the left one better represents a cubic ottoman with a more realistic and accurate model.
The left one is better.
