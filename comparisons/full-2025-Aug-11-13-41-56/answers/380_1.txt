Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one depicts a fragmented globe with unclear support structure, not clearly resembling a globe on a pedestal.
   - The right one shows a well-defined spherical form with a distinct pedestal.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears fragmented and lacks solidity, with unclear structure.
   - The right one appears more solid, cohesive, and plausible as a 3D object.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has textures that are indistinct and unclear.
   - The right one has sharper, more realistic textures with more detail.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
