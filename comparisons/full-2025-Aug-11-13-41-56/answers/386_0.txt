Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one represents a cylindrical object which aligns with "a cylindrical bin."
   - The right one represents a structure resembling a table, consistent with "a rectangular desk."
   - Both models cover the attributes of the text prompt well.
   The left/right one is better or cannot decide. Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left one appears solid and plausible as a cylindrical bin.
   - The right one exhibits a plausible desk shape, but with slight irregularities in the legs.
   The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a consistent texture but is less detailed.
   - The right one has sharper and more detailed textures, particularly on the tabletop.
   The right one is better.

Final answer:
