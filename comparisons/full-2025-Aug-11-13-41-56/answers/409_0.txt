Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model has a more detailed rendering of a stool, but the sofa's rectangular nature is less clear.
   - The right model clearly shows a rectangular sofa, but the stool shape isn't very distinguishable.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears more structurally coherent and solid.
   - The right model looks more abstract, lacking clear definition and structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has clearer and more detailed textures.
   - The right model's textures are blurry and lack detail.
   - The left one is better.

Final answer:
