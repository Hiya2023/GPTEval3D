Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: The model is round with a vivid floral texture, aligning well with the concept of a cushion, although the shape is irregular.
   - The right one: This model is more uniformly round and cushion-like, with a consistent pattern.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: The model seems less structured and solid. The irregular shape might not look plausible as a cushion.
   - The right one: Appears more solid and plausible as a cushion due to a consistent shape.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: The floral texture is detailed and vibrant, with a realistic pattern.
   - The right one: The texture is less detailed compared to the left.
   - The left one is better.
