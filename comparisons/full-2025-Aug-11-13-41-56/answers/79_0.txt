Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object has a simpler design with cylindrical armrests but lacks detail.
   - The right object matches the description better with clearer armrests and sofa structure.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: 
   - The left object appears more solid and has a simpler, more natural form.
   - The right object has more detail but seems less cohesive.
   - The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: 
   - The left object's texture aligns reasonably well with its geometry.
   - The right object shows better alignment, especially on the cushions.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: 
   - The left object's texture is simpler and lacks detail.
   - The right object has finer texture details but is slightly noisy.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: 
   - The left object has straightforward geometry but is less defined.
   - The right one offers more intricate geometry, especially on the cushions.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - The right object closely matches the text prompt and excels in detail and texture alignment.
   - The right one is better.
