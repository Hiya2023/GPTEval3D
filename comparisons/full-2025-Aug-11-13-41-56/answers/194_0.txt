Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object resembles a trapezoidal bookshelf more closely due to its shape.
   - The right object appears less trapezoidal and more abstract.
   The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object seems more natural and solid in form.
   - The right object has irregular shapes and appears less realistic.
   The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object has a more consistent alignment between texture and geometry.
   - The right object's textures do not align well with its geometry.
   The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures finer texture details and is more aesthetically aligned with the prompt.
   - The right object's textures are less detailed and more abstract.
   The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object's geometry is smoother and more organized.
   - The right object exhibits noisy and less coherent geometry.
   The left one is better.

6. Overall, the left object better satisfies the criteria based on the prompt and evaluation metrics.
   The left one is better.

Final answer:
