Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to have a complete spherical globe with visible continents, which aligns well with the "spherical globe" part of the prompt. However, the pedestal part is not distinctly visible.
   - The right one shows fragments of a globe and a faint cubic shape, aligning with the "cubic pedestal" part, but the globe is incomplete.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model appears solid and maintains a spherical shape, which seems plausible for a globe.
   - The right model shows fragmented and floating parts, making it less plausible as a solid structure.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has a more defined and colorful texture representing geographical details convincingly.
   - The right model has faded, less detailed textures, making it less realistic.
   - The left one is better.
