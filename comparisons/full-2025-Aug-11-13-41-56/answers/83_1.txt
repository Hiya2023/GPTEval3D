Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left object depicts a globe that maintains a clear spherical shape and a discernible pedestal although not cubic.
   - The right object also shows a spherical globe on a pedestal, but the pedestal is not clearly cubic either. 
   - Cannot decide.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left object looks more cohesive and structured in terms of the pedestal’s design.
   - The right object's pedestal looks less defined and natural.
   - Left is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left object’s textures align with the shapes better, showing more consistency between the RGB and normal images.
   - The right object’s textures and geometry seem less aligned.
   - Left is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left object captures more detailed textures of the globe and pedestal, appearing less blurry.
   - The right object lacks fine texture details and appears more abstract.
   - Left is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left object has a smoother and more organized geometry observable in the normal map.
   - The right object shows more noise in its geometry.
   - Left is better.

6. Overall, given the evaluations above, the left object is preferred for its comprehensive alignment of textures and geometry, as well as better details and plausibility.
