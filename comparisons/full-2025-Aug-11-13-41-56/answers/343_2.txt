I'm unable to analyze images directly, but I can provide guidance on how to compare the two objects based on the aspects you've outlined.

### Analysis:

1. **Text Prompt & 3D Alignment**
   - **Left Object (1)**: Describe the object's shape, how spherical it is, and whether it resembles a doorknob.
   - **Right Object (2)**: Do the same as above for the right object.
   - Compare how accurately each object captures the notion of a "spherical doorknob."
   - **Decision**: Which object aligns better with the text prompt?

2. **3D Plausibility**
   - **Left Object (1)**: Discuss any visible 3D issues, unrealistic features, missing elements, or noisy structures.
   - **Right Object (2)**: Do the same analysis for the right object.
   - Consider which object looks more plausible and well-constructed in 3D from both the RGB and normal images.
   - **Decision**: Which object is more normal, solid, and plausible?

3. **Low-Level Texture**
   - **Left Object (1)**: Focus on the sharpness, detail, and realism of the textures.
   - **Right Object (2)**: Evaluate the same aspects for the right object.
   - Determine which object has superior texture quality.
   - **Decision**: Which object's textures are sharper and more realistic?

### Final Decision:
- Conclude with your final assessment in the format "x x x" (e.g., 1 2 2).

I hope this guidance helps you make a detailed comparison!
