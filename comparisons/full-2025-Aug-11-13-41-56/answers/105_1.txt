Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left one resembles a square table but lacks clear definition; The right one clearly represents a square coffee table with appropriate proportions and design elements.
The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left one has distorted and irregular features, making it less plausible; The right one appears more structured and natural, with defined table legs and tabletop.
The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left one's texture doesn't align well with the geometry; The right one's texture appears more cohesive and fits the shape better.
The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left one lacks clear texture details and appears blurry; The right one exhibits more defined textures, especially on the tabletop.
The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left one shows disorganized shapes and lacks clear details; The right one has well-defined geometric features, especially noticeable in the legs.
The right one is better.

6. Overall, the right one captures the concept of the "square coffee table" more accurately and realistically.
The right one is better.
