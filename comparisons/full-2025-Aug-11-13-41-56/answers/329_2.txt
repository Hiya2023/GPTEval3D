Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - **Left:** The model appears to represent a cubic lamp with a clear cubic shape and a base that suggests a curve.
   - **Right:** The model has some semblance of a cubic shape but lacks distinct details and the base is not clearly defined.
   - **Decision:** Left (object 1) is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - **Left:** The model is solid with a clear shape and no apparent strange or duplicated structures.
   - **Right:** The model appears less defined and more abstract, with potential noise or indistinguishable structures.
   - **Decision:** Left (object 1) is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - **Left:** The texture has more detail and is sharper, providing a more realistic appearance.
   - **Right:** The texture is less detailed and more washed out.
   - **Decision:** Left (object 1) is better.
