Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment:
   - The left one: The model has a floral pattern but the shape is more cylindrical than conical and has a colorful texture that does not suggest a lamp.
   - The right one: The model clearly has a conical lampshade on a cylindrical base, fitting the prompt well.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one: Appears more vase-like and less stable with its broad top, lacking the solid structure of a lamp.
   - The right one: Exhibits a solid conical form with a plausible base, looking more structurally sound as a lamp.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one: Features more detailed and colorful floral textures that are vibrant and sharp.
   - The right one: Has a simpler texture that is less detailed.
   - The left one is better.
