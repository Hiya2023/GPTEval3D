Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left model appears to be a circular structure which doesn't align with the description of a "cubic lamp". 
   - The right model is a cubic structure on a base which fits the description.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left model looks abstract with a noisy structure, lacking a clear definition.
   - The right model appears more solid and functional, resembling a plausible lamp.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left model has indistinct textures and lacks detail.
   - The right model has sharper and more realistic textures, especially on the lamp surface.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
