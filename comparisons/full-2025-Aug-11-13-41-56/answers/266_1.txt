Analysis:
1. **Text prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - **Left (object 1)**: Features a detailed triangular traffic cone with realistic textures. However, it lacks a circular ball, which is a critical part of the text prompt.
   - **Right (object 2)**: Includes both a triangular traffic cone and a circular ball, matching the text description. Both elements are present and aligned accurately with the prompt.

The right one is better.

Final answer:
2
