Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to depict a 3D object resembling a diamond shape with frames, not clearly aligning with a "hexagonal mirror."
   - The right one clearly shows a hexagonal shape, which aligns well with the concept of a "hexagonal mirror."
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one has a more complex structure with potentially unnecessary features that could be seen as strange or not fully plausible for a mirror.
   - The right one, with its simple, clear hexagon shape, seems more plausible as a 3D structure for a mirror.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one shows detailed textures on its surfaces, including reflections and color variations.
   - The right one has a flat, uniform appearance without detailed textures.
   - The left one is better.
