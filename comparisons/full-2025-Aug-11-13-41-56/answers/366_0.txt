Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one appears to depict a simple spherical shape, which aligns with the "spherical" aspect of the prompt but lacks the doorknob's attached component.
   - The right one shows a more complete doorknob structure with a spherical shape and an attached base, aligning well with the entire "spherical doorknob" prompt.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears to be a floating sphere without additional supportive structures, making it less plausible as a doorknob.
   - The right one shows a more realistic doorknob with connecting parts, appearing more solid and functional.
   - The right one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has a smooth texture but lacks detail and realism.
   - The right one, while not perfect, has more texture and detail, especially around the base and handle.
   - The right one is better.

Final answer:
