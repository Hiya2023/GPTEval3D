Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a clear triangular shape with additional internal structures and a distinct pole, aligning well with the concept of a road sign.
   - The right one is also triangular and features a signpost; however, the texture is less defined.
   - The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more robust and has clear edges and a structured look.
   - The right one, while plausible, lacks solidity in comparison.
   - The left one is better.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left has more varied colors and patterns, though they appear slightly noisy.
   - The right one, although less colorful, has a smoother and more consistent texture.
   - The right one is better.
