Analysis:

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object includes a triangular traffic cone but lacks a circular ball, while the right object features a cone only. Both fail to capture the ball, but the left object better represents a triangular cone.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears more solid and natural, with a more defined cone structure compared to the right, which lacks detail.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object shows better alignment between geometry and texture, with consistent cone shape and texture. The right object has mismatched geometry and texture.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures finer texture details, whereas the right object appears blurry and less defined.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object's normal maps depict more organized and detailed geometry. The right object's normal maps are less refined.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left object consistently performs better across all criteria, with superior alignment, plausibility, texture details, and geometry details.
The left one is better.
