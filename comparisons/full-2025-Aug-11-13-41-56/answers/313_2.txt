Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a curved base and some elements of a lamp but is more cylindrical than cubic.
   - The right one appears more cubic in form but has a curved element in the base.
   - The right one is better in aligning with the “cubic lamp with a curved base” prompt.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one looks more like a plausible solid object with clear form.
   - The right one seems to have uneven surfaces and less structured detail.
   - The left one is better for 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has smoother textures with some reflective properties.
   - The right one has more texture detail, providing a realistic rough surface.
   - The right one is better for low-level texture.

Final answer:
