Analysis:

1. Text prompt & 3D Alignment: 
   - The left one has a more traditional lamp shape with a curved base and a lampshade, but lacks a cubic form.
   - The right one has a more cubic shape, aligned with the "cubic lamp" description, but the base doesn't appear curved.
   - The right one is better as it captures the cubic aspect.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one appears more like a solid and plausible lamp with recognizable parts.
   - The right one has unusual textures and structures that make it look less plausible as a lamp.
   - The left one is better in terms of 3D plausibility.

3. Low-Level Texture:
   - The left one has clearer textures and more detailed representation.
   - The right one appears rough and less detailed.
   - The left one is better in terms of texture.

Final answer:
