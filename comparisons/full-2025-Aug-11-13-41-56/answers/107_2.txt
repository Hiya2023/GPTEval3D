Analysis:

1. Text Prompt & Asset Alignment: 
   - The left one does not clearly depict a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests. The shape is not well-defined.
   - The right one clearly represents a rectangular sofa with cylindrical armrests and fits the prompt well.
   - The right one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility:
   - The left one lacks solid structure and has irregular shapes and textures.
   - The right one appears more natural and structured, with a solid form.
   - The right one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment:
   - The left one shows poor texture alignment with geometry, appearing disjointed.
   - The right one displays better alignment, matching texture with shape effectively.
   - The right one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details:
   - The left one has blurred textures lacking detail and definition.
   - The right one offers more detailed textures that are aesthetic and clear.
   - The right one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details:
   - The left one lacks intricate details, presenting a rough and unclear geometry.
   - The right one is smoother and shows more organized geometric details.
   - The right one is better.

6. Overall:
   - Considering all aspects, the right one clearly presents a better model in alignment, plausibility, texture, and geometric details.
   - The right one is better.
