分析：

1. Text prompt & Asset Alignment: The left object accurately depicts a spherical globe on a cubic pedestal, matching the text description. The right object features additional elements that deviate from the prompt.
The left one is better.

2. 3D Plausibility: The left object appears natural and solid, with correct proportions and no unusual structures. The right object includes unnecessary and implausible features.
The left one is better.

3. Geometry-Texture Alignment: The left object's textures adhere well to the globe and pedestal's geometry. The right object's alignment is disrupted by additional elements.
The left one is better.

4. Low-Level Texture Details: The left object captures fine details clearly without appearing blurry. The right object’s textures are more abstract and less focused.
The left one is better.

5. Low-Level Geometry Details: The left object exhibits smooth and well-organized geometry. The right object’s geometry is cluttered and less efficient.
The left one is better.

6. Overall: The left object consistently aligns with the criteria better than the right object.
The left one is better.
