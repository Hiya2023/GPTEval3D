I'm unable to view or analyze the images directly, but I can guide you on how to assess the 3D models given the description.

**Analysis:**
1. **Text Prompt & Asset Alignment**: 
   - Examine whether each model accurately represents a "rectangular laptop" and a "circular mousepad" as described.
   - For the left object (Object 1), see if there's any indication of a rectangular and a circular shape side by side.
   - For the right object (Object 2), determine if it depicts both the rectangular and circular elements correctly.
   
   Decision should be based on which model captures the rectangular and circular forms more effectively and accurately.

**Final Answer:**
Based on the description provided and the need to compare the text prompt with the given 3D models, you'll conclude with either the left, right, or undecided option. Since I can't view the images, you'll need to choose:

1 for Object 1 (left) is better,
2 for Object 2 (right) is better,
3 if you truly cannot decide.

Please use my analysis framework to make your conclusion.
